/**
 * The <code>Addressee</code> class represents MHS addressees, which can be
 * AWIPS site IDs, such as <code>BOX</code>, or special destinations, such as
 * <code>NWSTG</code>. Each <code>Addressee</code> object can hold a single
 * destination address.
 * <p>
 * Each MHS message must have at least one destination addressee. Addressees are
 * added to an <code>MhsMessage</code> object's {@link AddresseeList} using the
 * <code>addAddressee</code> or <code>addAckAddressee</code> methods. The only
 * difference between the two methods is that <code>addAckAddressee</code> will
 * generate an acknowledgment request while <code>addAddressee</code> will not.
 * <p>
 * Special destinations:
 * <p>
 * Below is a complete list of special addressees and their meanings. Messages
 * sent to any of these destinations will be routed to the NCF, where the
 * product ID (WMO header) will be used to determine message disposition
 * according to configuration.
 * <p>
 * <table border="1">
 * <tr>
 * <td>DEFAULTNCF</td>
 * <td>Product will be disseminated to various interfaces determined by address
 * expansion using the product ID. For instance, WWAs are disseminated via MHS
 * to all WFOs and RFC, Weather Wire, NWSTG, and over the SBN. Configuration

 * they wish to have this message disseminated widely.</td>
