/**
 * Grib post processor implementation to decode monthly CPC outlook grids
 * 
 * CPC long-range outlook grids (forecast projections of 30 days, 90-450 days at
 * 30-day intervals) do not contain the forecast periods within the data in the
 * usual way, and this must be calculated from the time information. The reftime
 * of each grid in the same run/delivery (which occurs monthly) contains a
 * subsequent hour (00:00:00 through 13:00:00). These hours are used to
 * determine the forecast period. E.g. for a reftime of 2008-10-15 01:00:00 the
 * '01' tells us that this grid is for the second forecast increment. Since
 * there is no 60-day forecast, an hour of '00' represents the 30-day outlook
 * and then there is a shift so that an hour of '01' represents the 90-day
 * outlook, hence the two calculations below, taken from the AWIPS I code.
