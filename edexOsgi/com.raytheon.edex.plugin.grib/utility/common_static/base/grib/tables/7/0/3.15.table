# CODE TABLE 3.15, Physical meaning of vertical coordinate
# 192-254 Reserved for local use
255:255:Missing
# Notes:
# (1) Negative values associated to this coordinate will indicate depth below ground surface.  If values are all below surface, use of entry 106 is recommended, with positive coordinate values instead.
# (2) The Eta vertical coordinate system involves normalizing the pressure at some point on a specific level by the mean sea level pressure at that point.
