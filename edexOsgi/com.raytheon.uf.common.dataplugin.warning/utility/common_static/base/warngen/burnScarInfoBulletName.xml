<!-- The following is an example on how to set up the bullets for a site
     specific burnscar location for CAN/EXP sections where you only want
     the name of the burn scar and not the scenarios -->
<!-- Notice we use many of the same bullet names as the dam break template.
     This is done in order to get WarnGen to read in the lat/lon box.
     This process can be done for any pre-configured FFW box. -->
<!-- 
<damInfoBullets>
<damInfoBullet bulletGroup="dam" bulletText="FourMile Burn Area" bulletName="FourMileBurnArea"  parseString="FOURMILE BURN AREA" showString="FOURMILE BURN AREA" coords="LAT...LON 4006 10542 4008 10537 4005 10535 4002 10540"/>
