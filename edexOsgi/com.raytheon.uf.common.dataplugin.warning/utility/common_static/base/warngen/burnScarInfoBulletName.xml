     specific burnscar location for CAN/EXP sections where you only want
     the name of the burn scar and not the scenarios -->
<!-- Notice we use many of the same bullet names as the dam break template.
     This is done in order to get WarnGen to read in the lat/lon box.
     This process can be done for any pre-configured FFW box. -->
