## The next section is for site specific burn scars and other areas that
## need a pre-defined polygon for a FFW. Each site should take the
## example below and customize it with the information they used in 
## AWIPS 1. The following is an example of a burn scar area for a
## pre-defined polygon in Boulders (BOU) cwa. 
## If you have any questions please contact Phil Kurimski - WFO DTX
