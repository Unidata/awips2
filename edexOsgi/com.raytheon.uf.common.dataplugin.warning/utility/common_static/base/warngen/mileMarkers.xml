 FOR EACH DATABASE TABLE IMPORTED USING THE importMarkersInfo.sh SCRIPT,
 THERE WILL BE **TWO** pointSource OBJECTS CREATED BELOW.
 ONE POINTSOURCE OBJECT REFERENCES THE 'NAME' FIELD IN THE DATABASE TABLE
 THE SECOND POINTSOURCE OBJECT REFERENCES THE 'GID" FIELD IN THE DATABASE TABLE
 
 FOR EACH ENTRY ONLY MODIFY THE pointSource variable (unique to each object) AND
          pointSource attribute (the tablename created from importMarkersInfo.sh)

 EXAMPLE FOR INTERSTATE 435 in the Kansas City Metro follows:
 
 The point source variables EAX_i435mm & EAX_i435mmid are used in the mileMarkers.vm 
 file. The pointSource attribute must match whatever database table you created
 with the importMarkersInfo.sh script. In this case our maps database table for 
 Interstate 435 was "EAX_i435". 
 
 For service backup purposes, PLEASE make sure that your maps database tables are prefixed
 with your office ID as it's possible (if not likely) that you and your backup offices could
 otherwise use identical interstate names. 
 
 Once you're done adding the pointSource pairs, additional configuration in
 mileMarkers.vm is required

 <pointSource variable="EAX_i435mm">
    <pointSource>EAX_i435</pointSource>
 	<pointField>NAME</pointField>

 	<withinPolygon>true</withinPolygon>
 	<maxResults>1000</maxResults>
 	<distanceThreshold>100</distanceThreshold>
 	<allowDuplicates>true</allowDuplicates>
 	<sortBy>
 		<sort>gid</sort>
  	</sortBy>
 </pointSource>
