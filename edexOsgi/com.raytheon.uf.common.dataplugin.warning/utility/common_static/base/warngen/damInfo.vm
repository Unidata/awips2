## The next section is for site specific dams. Each site should take the
## example below and customize it for their dams with the information
## from the LLL-damInfo.txt file in AWIPS 1. If you have any questions

## Look for site specific selections to override the 4th bullet and
## to set up the headlines and additional info used in the product.
## This loop assumes you end each site specific selection with
## the word "Dam". If you end with a different word you will need
## to modify the loop below.
########################################################################
#foreach ($bullet in $bullets)
#if ($bullet.endsWith("Dam"))
    #set($ctaSelected = "YES")
    #set($sitespecSelected = "YES")

    #set($emergencyHeadline = "#capitalize(${emergencyText} 'ALL')")
    #set($headline = "For ${reportType2} ${damName} on the ${riverName} ")
## The following line will capitalize the headline in the product.
## If the headline will be mixed case just comment out the line below.    
    #set($headline = "#capitalize(${headline} 'ALL')")
    #set($reportType1 = "${reportType2} ${damName} on the ${riverName}")
##    #set($reportType1 = "${reportType2} ${damName} ON THE ${riverName}${reportInfo}")
