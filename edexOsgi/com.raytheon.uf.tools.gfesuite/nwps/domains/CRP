# TO DO: Update the domains below to reflect the area/s that you are 
#        interested in (must reside inside of you outer domain defined
#        above). Also, remember to remove or comment out the remaining
#        example nests below that were configured for another area. Once
#        your nests are configured, just toggle the NESTGRIDS to '1'
#        (Default configuration is off or '0') and you will have control 
#        from the GFE GUI to activate your nests during your runs.
#
# STATIONARY VS NONSTATIONARY MODE: 
# 
# STATN=STA for STATIONARY RUNS, STATN=NON for NON-STATIONARY RUNS.
# The default value is NONstationary for CG1 (outer grid) and STAtionary 
# for the nested grids. Change this only if you know what you are doing.
# You can choose STA or NON for a particular nested grid. In general, 
# if your domain that you define as a nest below is >= 100 km^2, then 
# set STATN=NON. For the very small domains or nests (<= 100 km^2)
# set STATN=STA.  
#
