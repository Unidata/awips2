##
# Ask the server for an attribute from the VTECPartners script for a site.
# Normally, the site is taken from the GFESUITE_SITEID environment variable,
# but the site may also be passed as a parameter, in case GFESUITE_SITEID is
# not set or info for an alternate site is needed. 
# 
# @param host: The host from which to request the site IDs
# @param port: The port to which the request should be sent.
# @param site: The site whose VTECPartners script should be consulted. Defaults
#              to None, which causes os.environ['GFESUITE_SITEID'] to be used.
# @param default: A value to return if VTECPartners does not have the attribute 
#                 (defaults to None).
# @return: The list of default servers, or None.
# @raise Exception: When no site is specified and the GFESUITE_SITEID 
#                   environment variable is not set, or as raised by the thrift 
#                   client.
