# Script description: This script can create a netcdf file containing IFPS     #
#    grids, quality control the netcdf file, send the file to a local rsync    #
#    server (ls2/3), and then rsync the file to the remote rsync servers.      #
#    Quality Control involves iscMosaic'ing the contents of the netcdf file    #
#    into the Restore database in GFE. If a failure is detected for any of the #
#    grids, then the forecasters will get a red-banner alarm and the script    #
#    will recreate the netcdf file.                                            #
#                                                                              #
#    To upload netcdf files use the following arguments:                       #
#       ./rsyncGridsToCWF.sh wfo                                               #
#    (where wfo is the three character wfo id)                                 #
#                                                                              #
#    This script is designed to work in service backup situations. This script #
#    is launched from the Scripts... menu in GFE and it will work in both      #
#    operational and service backup situations.                                #

# Needed configuration on ls2/3:  For each wfo that you run this script for,   #

#                                 directory. (where wfo is the 3 character     #

# 05/21/08:  Added the --address= switch to the rysnc commands in an attempt   #
#            resolve rsync issues after switch to NOAANet. ls cluster only. vtm#
# 05/21/08:  If rsync fails to move the file to the server, then the script    #
#            will now retry 4 more times. vtm                                  #

# 06/11/08:  Fixed bug. If rsync fails more than 5 times, the script was       #
#            supposed to stop. Instead it kept trying. vtm                     #
# 06/19/08:  Changed the directory on AWIPS where the netcdf file is created.  #
#            Now using a drive local to machine for performance reasons.       #
#            New directory is now /awips2/fxa/netcdf. This directory will be    #
#            created by the script if it doesn't exist. vtm                    #
# 06/19/08:  Changed script to remove AWIPS netcdf and log files sooner. vtm   #

# 07/11/08:  Pointed most all of script feedback to a log file that can be     #
#            found in the /awips/GFESuite/primary/data/logfiles/yyyymmdd/      #
#            directory called netcdf_rsync.log. (LX workstations put the file  #
#            into the /awips/GFESuite/data/logfiles/yyyymmdd directory.) vtm   #
# 07/07/11:  Put in code to limit the time period of the netcdf file. vtm      #
# 04/16/12:  Added a little error checking for work directory and replaced     #
#            the hard-coded path to /awips2/fxa/bin with $FXA_BIN.  Removed    #
#            awips1 code.                                                      #
# 11/02/12:  Restored error checking for AWIPS2.                               #
# 04/22/13:  Update the permission of the log directories.                     #
# 02/24/14:  Create the file if rsync_parms.${site} is not available,          #
#            and mkdir the site directory on the local rsync server if it      #
#            does not exist.                                                   #
