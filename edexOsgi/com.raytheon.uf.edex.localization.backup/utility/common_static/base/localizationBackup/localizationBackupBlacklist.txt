# This file lists all localization paths that will NOT be sent to backup
# sites. This file overrides the whitelist in localizationBackupList.txt.
# That is, that file is checked first to determine which files are sent out,
# then this file determines which among those are NOT sent. The SITE version of
# this file adds to the BASE version, and all other levels are ignored.
#
# A line that starts with '#' is treated as a comment, and any other line is a
# localization level and path:
# localization_level:localization_type/subpath/to/file
#
# A simple example would be 
# SITE:common_static/textdb/textCategoryClass.txt
#
# You can use * to match any level, type, or any part of a path. For example,
# to match all SITE afos2awips files:
# SITE:common_static/afos2awips/*
#

# BASE is hard-coded to never send to backup sites, but is included anyway
# for safety.
