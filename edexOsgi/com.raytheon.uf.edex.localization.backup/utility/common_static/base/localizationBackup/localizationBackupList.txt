# This file lists all localization paths that will be sent to backup sites
# when a file at any path changes. The SITE version of this file adds to the
# BASE version, and all other levels are ignored.
#
# A line that starts with '#' is treated as a comment, and any other line is a
# localization level and path:
# localization_level:localization_type/subpath/to/file
#
# A simple example would be 
# SITE:common_static/textdb/textCategoryClass.txt
#
# You can use * to match any level, type, or any part of a path. For example,
# to match all SITE afos2awips files:
# SITE:common_static/afos2awips/*
#
# REGION:*
# SITE:*
# CONFIGURED:*
