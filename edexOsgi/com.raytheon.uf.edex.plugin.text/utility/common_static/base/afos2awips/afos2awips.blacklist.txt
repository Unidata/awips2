# This is the afos2awips "blacklist" file. It is the opposite of afos2awips.txt
# in that it contains entries that should NOT be used. This file follows the
# same format as afos2awips.txt.
#
# This is an incremental override file--see the BASE afos2awips.txt for the
# override order.
#
# Note that the BASE blacklist is ignored. Any manual additions to the blacklist
# should go in the SITE file.
#
# The typical usage of this file is to add entries here that are present in
# afos2awips.txt, but should not be used at the current site.
#
# Example entry:
#AAATIBCAX WECA42 PHEB
