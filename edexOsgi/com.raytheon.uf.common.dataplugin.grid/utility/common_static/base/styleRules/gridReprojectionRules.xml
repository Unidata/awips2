        This is an incremental override file, indicating that the files
        at different localization levels will be combined.

<!--

  The <gridReprojectionRules> element consists of a sequence of
  <rule> elements with he following attributes, all of which are
  optional.

  Only the highest priority localization level of this file will
  be used.  The first rule in the file that matches is used.

  Attribute Name        Value                 Purpose
  ===================== ===================== =======================
  modelName             Regular expression    Matches grid model name
  displayType           "                     Matches display type (IMAGE, CONTOUR, STREAMLINE,
                                              BARB, ARROW, ICON, DUALARROW)
  srcProjection         "                     Matches grid model's projection name
  dstProjection         "                     Matches display projection name
  reproject             ALWAYS|NEVER|TEST     Controls re-projection.  Default behavior (TEST)
                                              is to test if the mapping is not too distorted.

  To prevent lat/lon grids from being re-projected, use the following rule.

      <rule srcProjection="Equidistant_Cylindrical" reproject="NEVER" />

  To prevent images from being re-projected, use the following rule.

      <rule displayType="IMAGE" reproject="NEVER" />

  Grid model projection names can be found examining the metadata
  database.  Example:

      select substring(crs from 'PROJECTION.*?,') from grid_info, gridcoverage
        where datasetid = 'GlobalWave' and grid_info.location_id = gridcoverage.id limit 1;

  Display projection names can be found by examining scale bundle or procedure XML files.
