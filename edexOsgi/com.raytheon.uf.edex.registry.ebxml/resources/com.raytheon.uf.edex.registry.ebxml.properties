# Changing these memory permit properties will require changes to the java heap settings. The amount of heap space

# replicating objects. Objects larger then the permit size will require permits to send and will wait if no permits are
# available. Objects smaller then the permit size will not wait for permits. For example with the default settings a

# Registry Web server IP access control configurations
# This is a ; delimited list of IP access configurations
# 
#An empty white list is treated as match all. If there is at least one entry in the white list, 
#then a request must match a white list entry. Black list entries are always applied, so that 
#even if an entry matches the white list, a black list entry will override it. 
#
#Internet address specification is separated from the URI pattern using the "|" (pipe) character. 
#URI patterns follow the servlet specification for simple * prefix and suffix wild 
#cards (e.g. /, /foo, /foo/bar, /foo/bar/*, *.baz).
#
#Examples of the entry specifications are:
#
#    10.10.1.2 - all requests from IP 10.10.1.2
#    10.10.1.2|/foo/bar - all requests from IP 10.10.1.2 to URI /foo/bar
#    10.10.1.2|/foo/* - all requests from IP 10.10.1.2 to URIs starting with /foo/
#    10.10.1.2|*.html - all requests from IP 10.10.1.2 to URIs ending with .html
#    10.10.0-255.0-255 - all requests from IPs within 10.10.0.0/16 subnet
#    10.10.0-.-255|/foo/bar - all requests from IPs within 10.10.0.0/16 subnet to URI /foo/bar
#    10.10.0-3,1,3,7,15|/foo/* - all requests from IPs addresses with last octet equal to 1,3,7,15 in subnet 10.10.0.0/22 to URIs starting with /foo/
