/**
 * An index buffer builder which attempts to dynamically determine a correct
 * maximum radius to use for filtering triangles to achieve an alpha shape. This
 * can be useful if the spacing of the data is not known or could be
 * particularly distorted.
 * 
 * Similar to the {@link IndexBufferBuilder}, triangles are filtered off of the
 * circumradius. The dynamic filtering is achieved by automatically accepting
 * 90% of the triangles, those with the smallest circumradius. The remaining 10%
 * are only included if their circumradius is less than 4 times the largest
 * radius from the 90%. For example if your radii are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
 * 10, then 1-9 will be automatically included and the 10 will also be included
 * because it is less than the maximum acceptable value of 9*4 = 36.
 * 
 * This methodology should not be considered mathematically robust and could be
 * changed in the future. It was derived by fiddling with the numbers with some
 * sample data. The primary advantages of this simplistic approach is that it
 * can be achieved without iterating over the triangles multiple times to
 * calculate statistical values and it easily allows datasets with low deviation
 * to be 100% included in the result. Removing good triangles is considered more
 * dangerous than leaving in large triangles so having a very broad range of
 * acceptance is considered an advantage.
