      This is the default logging configuration file for all non-operational and
      development EDEX modes. This file will not be present on an operational system. 
      An instance specific logback configuration file will need to be created for 
      any new operational EDEX modes. If an operational instance-specific logback 
      configuration file is not created, everything will be logged for that EDEX 
      instance when it is deployed operationally as though there was no logging 
      configuration.
