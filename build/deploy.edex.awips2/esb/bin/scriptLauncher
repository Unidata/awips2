# This starts the desired script passing the script name and arguments as a 
# single string ("$@"). It then sends stdout/stderr to the bit bucket 
# (>&/dev/null).
# The stdin for the script is also the bit bucket (</dev/null) so if used it 
# immediately indicates end of file. Finally the script is set to run in the 
# background (&) so the launcher returns without waiting for the script to 
# return.
