These data files are then decoded and stored as HDF5 and Postgres metadata by \nEDEX\n. \n\n\nUnidata supports two visualization frameworks for rendering data: \nCAVE\n, and the Python Data Access Framework (\npython-awips\n).\n\n\n\n\nInstall CAVE 17.1.1\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux x86_64\n\n\ninstallCAVE.sh \n\n\n\n\n\n\nmacOS\n\n\nDownload and install both\nawips2-cave-17.1.1.dmg \nawips-python-jep.pkg \n\n\n\n\n\n\n32-bit Windows\n\n\nawips-cave.msi \n\n\n\n\n\n\n64-bit Windows\n\n\nawips-cave.amd64.msi \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEDEX Data Server 17.1.1\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLinux x86_64\n\n\ninstallEDEX.sh \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead full EDEX install instructions...\n\n\n\n\nLicense\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUnidata AWIPS source code and binaries (RPMs) are considered to be in the public domain, meaning there are no restrictions on any download, modification, or distribution in any form (original or modified).

The following components, working together and communicating, compose the entire AWIPS system.\n\n\nEDEX\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe main server for AWIPS.  Qpid sends alerts to EDEX when data stored by the LDM is ready for processing.  These Qpid messages include file header information which allows EDEX to determine the appropriate data decoder to use.  The default ingest server (simply named ingest) handles all data ingest other than grib messages, which are processed by a separate ingestGrib server.  After decoding, EDEX writes metadata to the database via Postgres and saves the processed data in HDF5 via PyPIES.   A third EDEX server, request, feeds requested data to CAVE clients. EDEX ingest and request servers are started and stopped with the commands \nedex start\n and \nedex stop\n, which runs the system script \n/etc/rc.d/init.d/edex_camel\n\n\n\n\nRead More: How to Install EDEX\n\n\n\n\nCAVE\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCommon AWIPS Visualization Environment. The data rendering and visualization tool for AWIPS. CAVE contains of a number of different data display configurations called perspectives.  Perspectives used in operational forecasting environments include \nD2D\n (Display Two-Dimensional), \nGFE\n (Graphical Forecast Editor), and \nNCP\n (National Centers Perspective). CAVE is started with the command \n/awips2/cave/cave.sh\n or \ncave.sh\n\n\n\n\nRead More: How to Install CAVE\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLDM\n\uf0c1\n\n\nhttp://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm/\n\n\nThe \nLDM\n (Local Data Manager), developed and supported by Unidata, is a suite of client and server programs designed for data distribution, and is the fundamental component comprising the Unidata Internet Data Distribution (IDD) system. In AWIPS, the LDM provides data feeds for grids, surface observations, upper-air profiles, satellite and radar imagery and various other meteorological datasets.   The LDM writes data directly to file and alerts EDEX via Qpid when a file is available for processing.  The LDM is started and stopped with the commands \nedex start\n and \nedex stop\n, which runs the commands \nservice edex_ldm start\n and \nservice edex_ldm stop\n\n\nedexBridge\n\uf0c1\n\n\nedexBridge, invoked in the LDM configuration file \n/awips2/ldm/etc/ldmd.conf\n, is used by the LDM to post \"data available\" messaged to Qpid, which alerts the EDEX Ingest server that a file is ready for processing.\n\n\nQpid\n\uf0c1\n\n\nhttp://qpid.apache.org\n\n\nApache Qpid\n, the Queue Processor Interface Daemon, is the messaging system used by AWIPS to facilitate communication between services.  When the LDM receives a data file to be processed, it employs \nedexBridge\n to send EDEX ingest servers a message via Qpid.  When EDEX has finished decoding the file, it sends CAVE a message via Qpid that data are available for display or further processing. Qpid is started and stopped by \nedex start\n and \nedex stop\n, and is controlled by the system script \n/etc/rc.d/init.d/qpidd\n\n\nPostgreSQL\n\uf0c1\n\n\nhttp://www.postgresql.org\n\n\nPostgreSQL\n, known simply as Postgres, is a relational database management system (DBMS) which handles the storage and retrieval of metadata, database tables and some decoded data.  The storage and reading of EDEX metadata is handled by the Postgres DBMS.  Users may query the metadata tables by using the termainal-based front-end for Postgres called \npsql\n. Postgres is started and stopped by \nedex start\n and \nedex stop\n, and is controlled by the system script \n/etc/rc.d/init.d/edex_postgres\n\n\nHDF5\n\uf0c1\n\n\nhttp://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/\n\n\nHierarchical Data Format (v.5)\n is the primary data storage format used by AWIPS for processed grids, satellite and radar imagery and other products.   Similar to netCDF, developed and supported by Unidata, HDF5 supports multiple types of data within a single file.  For example, a single HDF5 file of radar data may contain multiple volume scans of base reflectivity and base velocity as well as derived products such as composite reflectivity.  The file may also contain data from multiple radars. HDF5 is stored in \n/awips2/edex/data/hdf5/\n\n\nPyPIES (httpd-pypies)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPyPIES\n, Python Process Isolated Enhanced Storage, was created for AWIPS to isolate the management of HDF5 Processed Data Storage from the EDEX processes.  PyPIES manages access, i.e., reads and writes, of data in the HDF5 files.  In a sense, PyPIES provides functionality similar to a DBMS (i.e PostgreSQL for metadata); all data being written to an HDF5 file is sent to PyPIES, and requests for data stored in HDF5 are processed by PyPIES.\n\n\nPyPIES is implemented in two parts: 1. The PyPIES manager is a Python application that runs as part of an Apache HTTP server, and handles requests to store and retrieve data. 2. The PyPIES logger is a Python process that coordinates logging. PyPIES is started and stopped by \nedex start\n and \nedex stop\n, and is controlled by the system script \n/etc/rc.d/init.d/https-pypies",

Selections for \nGFE\n, \nGrids\n, \nLightning\n, \nMap Overlays\n, \nRadar\n, \nSatellite\n, \nRedbook\n, and \nVIIRS\n are available.  All products loaded with the Product Browser are given default settings.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwitch Pane Layouts\n\uf0c1\n\n\nwill switch between the single page (default) view and the 5-panel WFO view (centered on OAX by default).\n\n\n\n\nTime Options (Ctrl + T)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis check button enables/disables the ability to select the time interval between frames of real-time or model data. This feature has the added benefit of allowing you to view extended amounts of data (temporally) but stay within the limits of 64 frames. For example, METAR surface plots, which typically display every hour, can be set to display every three hours via the Select Valid Time and Time Resolution Dialog Box.\n\n\nWhen the Time Options check button is selected, the next product you choose to display in the Main Display Pane launches either the Select Valid Time and Time Resolution dialog box or the Select\nOffset and Tolerance dialog box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are loading data to an empty display and the Time Options check button is enabled, the Select Valid Time and Time Resolution dialog box opens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValid Time:\n In this column of dates/times, you may choose the one that will be the first frame loaded onto the Large Display Pane. The Default option is the most recent data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Resolution:\n This column contains various time increments in which the data can be displayed. Once you make a selection, the Valid Time Column indents the exact times that will\nbe displayed. The Default resolution displays the most recent frames available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Time Options check button enabled for a display that already contains data, when you choose the data to be overlaid in the Main Display Pane, the Select Offset and Tolerance dialog\nbox appears, providing the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffset\n: This column contains various time increments at intervals before, at, or after the time you selected for the first product that is displayed in the Main Display Pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTolerance\n: The options in this column refer to how strict the time matching is. \"None\" means an exact match, while \"Infinite\" will put the closest match in each frame, regardless of how\nfar off it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Scale (Ctrl + S)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis check button enables/disables the ability to display data on its native scale. For example, if you enable Data Scaling and select a product from an alternate radar, the data will be displayed with that radar in the center of the screen. Other data can be overlaid on this \"dynamic\" scale until the Main Display Pane is cleared or a non-plan-view product is loaded.\n\n\n\n\nImage Combination (Insert)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis check button enables/disables the ability to display two images at once. You can also enable/disable the ability to combine images by using the Toggle Image Combination iconified button on the Toolbar.\n\n\nCombined-image displays have been improved by removing the valid time for non-forecast products and removing the date string (time is kept) from the left side of the legend. In particular, this\nmakes All-Tilts radar legends more usable.\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Properties\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis menu option opens the Display Properties dialog box. All the options available in this dialog box are also available on the Toolbar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoop Properties (Ctrl + L)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLoop Properties is another dialog box that can be opened from the Options menu or from the Loop Properties iconified button on the D2D Toolbar, or by using the Ctrl + L keyboard shortcut. The dialog allows you to adjust the forward and backward speeds, with 0 = off and 10 = maximum speed. You can set the duration of the first and last frame dwell times to between zero and 2.5 seconds.\n\n\nYou can turn looping on or off by checking the Looping check button. There is also a Looping button located on the Toolbar that enables/disables the animation in the large display pane. Finally, you can turn looping on and increase/decrease forward speed by pressing Page Up/Page Down on your keyboard, and turn looping off with the Left or Right Arrow keys. On the toolbar, you can use the button to start/stop looping.\n\n\n\n\nImage Properties (Ctrl + I)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Image Properties dialog box can be opened here or by using the Image Properties iconified button on the D2D Toolbar, or using using the Ctrl + I keyboard shortcut. This dialog box provides options that allow you to change the color table; adjust the brightness, contrast, and alpha of either a single image or combined images; fade between combined images; and/or interpolate the displayed data.\n\n\n\n\nSet Time\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis option allows you to set the CAVE clock, located on the bottom of the screen, to an earlier time for reviewing archived data.\n\n\n\n\nSet Background Color\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can now set the background display color on your workstation. You can also set the background display color for a single pane via mouse Button 3 (B3).\n\n\n\n\nSwitching Perspectives\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCAVE \n Perspective\n\n\nD2D is one of many available CAVE perspectives.  By selecting the \nCAVE\n \n \nPerspective\n menu you can switch into the \nGFE\n, \nHydro\n, \nLocalization\n, \nMPE\n, or \nNational Centers Perspective\n (which is available in the \nOther...\n submenu. Nobody seems to know why the NCP is not listed with the other perspectives, or how to make it appear with them).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAVE Preferences\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPreferences and settings for the CAVE client can be found in the \nCAVE \n Preferences\n menu.\n\n\nSet the Localization Site and server for the workstation; configure mouse operations, change performance levels, font magnification, and text workstation hostname.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad Mode\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUnder the Display Properties option is Load Mode, which provides different ways to display data by manipulating previous model runs and inventories of data sets. The selected load mode is shown on the toolbar when the Load Mode menu is closed.\n\n\nA description of the Load Mode options follow.\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n: Displays forecast data only from the latest model run, but also backfills at the beginning of the loop with available frames from previous runs to satisfy the requested number of\nframes.\n\n\nValid time seq\n: Displays the most recent data and fills empty frames with previous data. For models, it provides the product from the latest possible run for every available valid time.\n\n\nNo Backfill\n: Displays model data only from the most recent model run time with no backfilling to fill out a loop. Using this Load Mode prevents the mixing of old and new data.\n\n\nPrevious run\n: Displays the previous model run, backfilling with frames from previous runs at the beginning of the loop to satisfy the requested number of frames.\n\n\nPrev valid time seq\n: Displays the previous model run and fills empty frames with previous model data or analyses.\n\n\nPrognosis loop\n: Shows a sequence of n-hour forecasts from successive model runs.\n\n\nAnalysis loop\n: Loads a sequence of model analyses but no forecasts.\n\n\ndProg/dt\n: Selects forecasts from different model runs that all have the same valid times. This load mode is available only when there are no other products loaded in the large display\npane.\n\n\nForced\n: Puts the latest version of a selected product in all frames without time-matching.\n\n\nForecast match\n: Overlays a model product only when its forecast times match those of an initially loaded product. This load mode is available only when another product is already\nloaded in the large display pane.\n\n\nInventory\n: Selecting a product when the load mode is set to Inventory brings up a Dialog Box with the available forecast and inventory times from which you can select the product you\nwant. Inventory loads into the currently displayed frame.\n\n\nSlot\n: Puts the latest version of a selected product in the currently displayed frame.",

In the Unidata AWIPS release it is a \nnon-operational\n forecasting tool, meaning it allows users to experiment and simulate with the drawing and text-generation tools, but prevents you from transmitting a generated warning upstream. \n\n\n\n\nIn order to select a feature it must be within your \nCAVE localization\n coverage (load \nMaps\n \n \nCounty Warning Areas\n to see coverages)\n\n\n\n\nSteps involved in using WarnGen in Unidata AWIPS CAVE 17.1.1\n\n\n\n\nLoad NEXRAD Display from the Radar menu.\n\n\nChoose a WFO site with active severe weather (LKZ is used in the video).\n\n\nRe-localize to this site in the CAVE \n Preferences \n Localization menu.\n\n\nLoad NEXRAD Display again and select a WSR-88D site to load a 2-panel display of 0.5 degree Reflectivity (N0Q) and Velocity (N0U).\n\n\nClick the WarnGen toolbar button or load from Tools \n WarnGen.\n\n\nDrag the storm marker to the center of a storm feature.\n\n\nStep through frames back and forth and adjust the marker to match the trajectory of the storm feature.\n\n\nFrom the WarnGen dialog select the type of warning to generate, the time range, the basis of the warning, and any threats to add (wind, hail, etc). \n\n\nClick \"Create Text\" at the bottom of the WarnGen dialog to generate a text warning product in a new window.\n\n\nClick \"Reset\" at the top of the WarnGen dialog to reset the storm marker at any time.\n\n\nSelect \"Line of Storms\" to enable a two-pointed vector which is to be positioned parallel to a storm line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoad NEXRAD level 3 display\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelect the menu \nRadar\n \n \nNEXRAD Display\n and note coverage areas of current severe weather.  We choose a WFO ID that contains some active severe weather (KLZK Little Rock, Arkansas, in this example).\n\n\nSelect SITE Localization\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOpen \nCAVE\n \n \nPreferences\n \n \nLocalization\n, select the WFO ID (KLZK) for the coverage area you want to use, followed by \nApply\n and then \nRestart\n.\n\n\nSelect the nearest WSR-88D location\n\uf0c1\n\n\nClick on any NEXRAD Display station to load a two-pane Reflectivity/Velocity view.\n\n\nLaunch WarnGen\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelect \nWarnGen\n from the D2D Toolbar or from the \nTools\n menu.  When started, the storm centroid marker appears and the WarnGen GUI will pop up as a separate window. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a Storm Motion Vector\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nClick and drag \nDrag Me to Storm\n to the feature you want to track (WarnGen uses a dot to track a single storm and a line to track a line of storms).\n\n\nStep back 3 to 4 frames.\n\n\nDrag the dot to the previous position of the feature you first marked.\n\n\nReview the product loop and make adjustments to ensure the vector is accurate.\n\n\n\n\nRestart\n\uf0c1\n\n\nClick the \nReset\n button to clear all current polygons and vectors and reset the storm centroid marker.\n\n\nRedrawing a Polygon\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelect the \nTrack\n button in the \n\"Redraw Box on Screen\"\n section to redraw a default warning polygon oriented along the storm motion track and containing the storm centroid dot for the most recent volume scan. The initial polygon may have unhatched areas that will be removed from the warning due to crossing CWAs or not meeting area thresholds in the county for inclusion. The Warned/Hatched Area button allow you to preview the polygon shape that will be issued, so you can make further edits.\n\n\nMoving Vertex Points\n\uf0c1\n\n\nVertices can be moved by clicking and dragging with the mouse. The warning polygon, including stippling, will update automatically.\n\n\n\n\nWhen reshaping your warning polygon in this manner, the philosophy is to include all areas that are at risk of experiencing severe weather covered by that warning type. Effective polygons account for uncertainty over time and typically widen downstream. There will be a lot of training provided on Storm-Based Warning Fundamentals in RAC and in the workshop, and this lesson is more focused on the basic mechanics.\n\n\nAdd and Remove Vertex Points\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere will be some occasions where you will want to add vertices to your warning polygon. Most often, these situations will involve line warnings with bowing segments or single storm warnings where you want to account for storm motion uncertainty or multiple threat areas that may have differing storm motions.\n\n\nNew vertices are added to the warning polygon using a context relative menu accessed by selecting the warning polygon line segments with a \nRight Mouse Button \"click and hold\"\n. \n\n\n\n\nHold right-click and select \nadd vertex\n.\n\n\nClick the left mouse button at the location you desire for the new vertex and the point is created there.\n\n\nClicking the middle mouse button (or scroll wheel) along an edge of the polygon will also place a vertex at that point.\n\n\n\n\nVertex points are removed from the warning polygon using the same context relative menu. Instead of selecting a line segment, you select the vertex you wish to remove and then \nclick and hold\n with right mouse button.  Hold right-click and select \nremove vertex\n. \n\n\nRestoring a Polygon\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen you are customizing a polygon in WarnGen, speed is critical. Everyone, even veteran warning forecasters, will occasionally draw a warning polygon one way and then realize, prior to sending the warning, that they want to draw the warning boundaries differently. Depending on the complexity of the changes you make to a warning polygon, sometimes it\u2019s faster to just start over from scratch. The easiest way to proceed, especially if you are still comfortable with the storm motion, is to select the \u201cTrack\u201d button from the \u201cRedraw Box on Screen from\u201d section of the WarnGen GUI.\n\n\nText Window\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUsing the customized settings in the WarnGen GUI, WarnGen translates the information into a text product that is displayed in a text window on the Text Display. Initially the AWIPS Header Block window appears, and you will just click Enter to modify the text of the warning. The auto-generated text contains the storm speed and direction, the counties and cities affected by the warning/advisory, the valid times of the product, the warning/advisory body text (including any optional bullets selected in the GUI), and additional code to help our partners to efficiently process and disseminate the warning/advisory. The locked parts of the text are highlighted in blue and most of your text should not need to be edited if you configured your WarnGen window correctly.\n\n\nFor some products like Severe Weather Statements, there are parts of text that must be edited that have wild-card characters around them that need to be removed after modifying the text inside (e.g. !\n WEAKENED.MOVED OUT OF THE WARNED AREA. \n!). When you attempt to send a product, WarnGen will instruct you to modify this text if you have not. Once the text looks ready for submission you click the Send button, and, on a live system, the warning will be transmitted for public broadcast after you press the Go Ahead button on the final WarnGen check. WES-2 Bridge has been implemented in a way that cannot interact with the live AWIPS processes and communications, so warnings issued on the WES-2 Bridge will not be transmitted as live products.\n\n\nNOTE: Edits made to product text in the editor window should be limited to items such as forecaster name/initials, call-to-action text, etc. If changes are warranted for items such as storm motion, warned counties, or Latitude/Longitude points, close the editor window and make changes using the D-2D and WarnGen graphical tools, then recreate the polygon and/or the text.\n\n\n\"Issuing\" a Warning\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWith a tracked storm in WarnGen:\n\n\n\n\nSelect \nCAVE \n New \n Text Workstation\n\n\nSelect the \nTrack\n button to preview the polygon\n\n\nSelect the \nCreate Text\n button.\n\n\nSelect \nEnter\n on the AWIPS Header Block window to enter the text editor. \n\n\nBlue text is locked and uneditable. You should not need to edit most text, and you need to be careful not to make the hazards inconsistent with the locked intensity summary at the bottom of the warning.\n\n\nIf WarnGen has text you need to edit, there will be wildcards around the text, and WarnGen will not let you send the warning until you modify it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead the text of the warning, identify your ETN number after the \u201cSV.W.\u201d (e.g. 0004) at the top of the warning, and make changes to the warning text if WarnGen tells you to.\n\n\nClick the \nSend\n button (will not actually send). Sending warnings on the WES-2 Bridge is safe because it is not connected to the live AWIPS communications route, and the transmission capabilities have been disabled, firewalled, and modified to prevent any risk of warnings going out.

CAVE currently only supports shape data in WGS84 unprojected latitude/longitude.\n\n\nThis section describes how to start the GIS application, configure the display attributes, and navigate through the various dialogs for importing map/map product shapefiles for display within CAVE. The following topics are discussed:\n\n\nDisplay GIS Data\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe GIS application is accessed through the CAVE menu by first selecting the Import option, and then choosing GIS Data from the Import submenu. The GIS DataStore Parameters dialog is comprised of four sections:\n\n\n\n\nDataStore Type\n: This section contains a data field where you select a file type from the dropdown\nlist.\n\n\nConnection Parameters\n:  This section contains a \nDirectory\n data field where you can either select from a dropdown list or browse to a directory containing a set of map shapefiles. Clicking the \nBrowse\n button opens the directory navigating/browser dialog, which allows you to navigate easily to the desired directory. After locating the desired directory, clicking the \nConnect\n button lists the available shapefiles.\n\n\n\n\nLoad As\n: In this section the shapefiles can be loaded as a Map or as a Product. Descriptions of both follow.\n\n\n\n\nMap\n: When this radio button is selected, the selected shapefile displays as a map. Click and hold the middle mouse button to open a pop-up menu and select \nShow Map Legend\n to display the \nMap ID\n in the \nLegend area\n at the bottom of the display.\n\n\nProduct\n: When this radio button is selected, the start and end date/time data fields become enabled. You can select a start and end date/time from the \nCalendar\n dialog.   Clicking on the Calendar icon opens the \nCalendar\n dialog. Loading a shapefile with the \nProduct\n radio button selected will return a shaded (color-filled) image of the Map Product. The \nProduct ID\n will appear in the Legend area at the bottom of the display after selecting \nShow Product Legend\n from the middle mouse click pop-up menu. The map product displays with the model data when the valid time of the model data falls within the start/end time range selected for the map product in the \nGIS DataStore Parameters\n dialog. When the valid time of the model data falls outside the start/end time of the map product, the map product image does not display.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable\n:  In this section you can select one of the shapefiles listed in the window for display. The selected file will be highlighted and the OK button at the bottom of the dialog will be enabled. Clicking the OK button closes the GIS DataStore Parameters dialog box and displays the selected map or map product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGIS Data Preferences\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUsing the \nPreferences\n dialog, you can modify certain GIS display attributes in CAVE without having the GIS application open. Access the GIS Viewer via \nCAVE\n \n \nPreferences\n \n \nGIS Viewer\n.\n\n\nThe attributes that can be modified within CAVE apply to the map/map product image displayed on the Main Display Pane. They are: color of the highlights; highlight line style; highlight line width; and map product opacity. The button next to the name of the attribute displays a swatch of the current value. Selecting this button opens a dialog for modifying that attribute and redefining the default value.\n\n\nA description of each attribute follows.\n\n\n\n\nHighlight Color\n: This button opens a dialog that includes a color wheel and a color palette. Clicking the OK button after changing the color sets the new color for the highlight that appears around a selected area (via the Attributes dialog), and closes the dialog. The new color is then displayed on the swatch.\n\n\nHighlight Style\n: This button opens a menu displaying a set of lines of differing styles. Doubleclicking on the desired line style sets the new style for the highlight that appears around a selected area (via the Attributes dialog), and closes the menu. The new line style is then displayed on the swatch.\n\n\nHighlight Width\n: This button opens a menu displaying a set of lines of differing widths. Double-clicking on the desired line width sets the new width for the highlight that appears around a selected area (via the Attributes dialog), and closes the menu. The new line width is then displayed on the swatch.\n\n\nProduct Opacity\n: This button opens the Set Opacity dialog for setting the default opacity level for GIS map product images. The dialog includes a swatch and a slider. Moving the slider increases or decreases the opacity level. Clicking the OK button sets the default level and closes the dialog.\n\n\n\n\nBeneath the four attributes are two buttons: Restore Defaults on the left and Apply on the right. The function of the Restore Defaults button is to restore \"all\" the attributes to their initial (default) values. Click this button only if you want to restore all attributes to their default values. If you accidentally click the Restore Defaults button, you will need to return to the attribute dialog(s) and redefine your desired values.\n\n\nUse the Apply button to save any changes you make to the default attribute settings. Wait until you are satisfied with all the values you have set, and then click the Apply button once to save all the changes. The values you set here for the attributes will then be applied to the GIS application as the new defaults.\n\n\nCustomizing the GIS Attribute Dialog\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou have the ability to highlight specific areas of the displayed map or map product image, and to hide other areas. These functionalities are executed through the \nAttributes dialog\n, commonly referred to as the \"Attributes Table\" because of its tabular style. To access the \nAttributes dialog\n, click and hold middle mouse button 3 (B3) on the Map ID in the Legend area to open the pop-up menu.\n\n\nFrom the pop-up menu select the \nDisplay Attributes\n option to open the \nAttributes\n dialog.\n\n\n\n\nThe Attributes dialog includes two menus, Annotation and Data, which allow you to control highlighting and visibility for both the displayed images and the information contained in the Attributes dialog. For each row of information on the Attributes dialog there is an associated map/map product image displayed on the Main Display Pane.\n\n\nHighlighting\n\uf0c1\n\n\nHighlighting Selected Areas\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo place a highlight around a selected area of the GIS display image and highlight the corresponding row on the Attributes dialog, click and hold B3 on the row you want to select. Check the Highlighted checkbox in the pop-up menu to activate highlighting. Multiple rows can be selected using Ctrl + B1 to select each row, which will highlight the selected row in blue. Then click and hold B3 on one of the selected rows; this will turn all selected blue rows dark gray  and open the pop-up menu. After checking the Highlighted checkbox all selected rows will be highlighted yellow and a highlighted border surrounding all the areas on the map corresponding to those selected rows will be highlighted with the color setup in the Preferences dialog box.\n\n\nUnhighlighting Selected Areas\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo unhighlight selected rows and associated highlighted borders around the areas of the image, click and hold B3 on the row or select multiple rows via Ctrl + B1 and then click and hold B3 to open the pop-up menu and uncheck the Highlighted checkbox.\n\n\n\u25e6 Unhighlighting All Areas\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo remove all highlighted borders around the areas of the image and remove all yellow highlighted rows on the Attributes dialog, select the Clear Highlights option under the Annotation menu.\n\n\n\n\nIf you are interested in a particular area but don't know the Feature ID, which is listed in the Attributes dialog, double-click on the area of interest on the image in the Main Display Pane and the corresponding row will be highlighted. Conversely, double-clicking on a particular row will place a highlighted border around the corresponding area on the image.\n\n\n\n\nControlling Visibility of Image Areas\n\uf0c1\n\n\nHiding Selected Areas\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo hide an area of the image displayed on the Main Display Pane, simply click and hold B3 on the row in the Attributes dialog corresponding to the area of interest. This will open a pop-up menu where you will uncheck the Visible checkbox to deactivate visibility for the selected area. If you want to hide multiple areas of the image, preselect the rows using Ctrl + B1 to highlight in blue the multiple selections; then click and hold B3 on one of the rows to open the pop-up menu. The deactivation of visibility will affect all areas corresponding to the selected rows. The areas of the image will disappear from the display and the selected row(s) on the Attributes dialog box will be shaded light gray.\n\n\nUnhiding Selected Areas\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo return the hidden area(s) of the image to their original visible state, click and hold B3 on the corresponding gray-highlighted row to open the pop-up menu. On the pop-up menu, check the Visible checkbox. To return multiple areas to their original visual state, use Ctrl + B1 to select all corresponding gray-highlighted rows; and then click and hold B3 on one of the rows to open the pop-up menu. Checking the Visible checkbox will affect all the selected rows and corresponding areas of the image. The previously gray highlighted rows will return to their orginal nonhighlighted state.\n\n\nUnhiding All Areas\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Make All Visible option under the Annotation menu enables you to return \"all\" hidden areas to their original visible state. All gray highlighted rows on the Attributes dialog will be returned to their original nonhighlighted state.\n\n\nConfiguring Attributes Table\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIn the Attributes dialog (\"Attributes Table\"), the options under the Data menu allow you to customize the table based on which columns to display and how the table is to be sorted.\n\n\nSelecting Columns to Display\n\uf0c1\n\n\nTo select which columns to display, select \nData \n Select Columns...\n.\n\n\nWithin the Select Columns dialog, you can select the column(s) you don't want displayed by\nfirst selecting the individual item(s) and then using the single arrow button to move the item\n(s) from the Displayed window to the Available window. Clicking the OK button saves the\nchange and removes the columns from the Attributes dialog. Use the double arrow button to\nmove all the items listed in the Displayed window to the Available window.\n\n\nBy default, all available columns are displayed.\n\n\nSorting Column Information\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelecting the \nSort\n option opens the \nSort Order\n dialog.\n\n\nWithin the Sort Order dialog, you can select a column from the dropdown list of displayed columns and select how you want the information in that column sorted. The other columns will adjust accordingly. Clicking the OK button (hidden in the Exhibit under the dropdown list) closes the Sort Order dialog and saves the change according to your selection. Clicking the Cancel button closes the dialog without making any changes to the Attributes Table.\n\n\nDisplaying a Sample of GIS Data Attribute Values\\\n\uf0c1\n\n\nYou can view a sample of a selected GIS data attribute directly on the Main Display Pane without having to open the Attributes dialog.\n\n\nTo open the Select Sample Attribute submenu, click and hold B3 on the Map Product ID in the Legend area to open a pop-up menu and select the Select Sample Attribute option. On the Select Sample Attribute submenu select the value you want displayed and then click the OK button. Click and hold B3 anywhere on the Main Display Pane to open a pop-up menu and check the Sample checkbox to activate the sampling functionality. Then, hovering your cursor over any area of the Map Product image will display the sample for the selected attribute\n\n\nGIS Data and Display Customization from within the GIS Application\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOnce the GIS data is displayed, there are several ways to customize the displayed data from within the GIS application. All customizations originate by selecting from the pop-up menu. To open the pop-up menu, click and hold mouse Button B3 (B3) on the GIS displayed image or on the Map/Map Product ID in the Legend area and move the cursor to the option you want to modify.",

The tool is used to monitor the same feature at a certain location. Without the Choose By ID tool, a monitored feature (over a period of time) could move away from its monitored location and another feature could move in its place. You can use Choose By ID to set points, baselines, and \"Home\" for conventional locations like METARs and RAOBs (Radiosonde Observations), but its primary use is for the WSR-88D-identified mesocyclone locations. You can also access the Choose By ID tool from the Tools menu on the Volume Browser.\n\n\n\n\nDistance Bearing\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelecting this tool displays six editable lines, each of which shows the azimuth and range of the labeled end of the line relative to the unlabeled end of the line. You can make the lines editable by clicking the center mouse button over the legend at the lower right of the display. Once in edit mode, a line can be moved as a unit and/or either of its end points can be adjusted.\n\n\n\n\nDistance Speed\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis tool can be used to determine the speed and direction of a storm or any other meteorological feature of interest. Selecting Distance Speed displays a Centroid Marker to move to the location of the storm or feature of interest in any two or more frames of displayed imagery (e.g., a satellite or radar loop). The system then displays a storm track with the direction (degrees) and speed (knots) of movement. When you select the Distance Speed option, the Distance Speed dialog box opens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMode\n: You have the following selections from this option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint\n: A radio button that allows you to set the Centroid Marker as a single point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolyline\n: A radio button that allows you to set the Centroid Marker as a polyline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n: You have the following selections from this option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime\n: A radio button that allows you to display time with the Centroid Marker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\n: A radio button that allows you to display speed with the Centroid Marker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance Scale\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis tool can be used to determine the size of a storm or any other meteorological feature of interest.\n\n\n\n\nFeature Following Zoom\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen you zoom in over a small area to be able to view a feature in detail, animation will often cause the feature to move into and then out of the field of view. This tool allows you to follow a feature of interest even when zoomed in to a small area.\n\n\nTo use this feature, first, you need to identify the location and motion of the feature, using Distance Speed or the WarnGen tracker. Once satisfied that the tracking icon is following the feature of interest, load this tool, and the center of the zoom area will track with the Distance Speed icon. Toggling the overlay off will resume the standard zooming behavior, and toggling it back on will reinvoke the feature following zoom.\n\n\nTime of Arrival / Lead Time\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelecting the Time Of Arrival / Lead Time option displays a tracking line from a feature's initial starting point in a past frame to its final position in the current frame. Once the final position is set, an Arrival Point is displayed. You can drag this point anywhere along the line to get the Time Of Arrival / Lead Time and Distance. You can also change the Mode from Point to Circular Front or Polyline anywhere along the line to better represent the feature(s).\n\n\nHome\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelecting the Home option displays a marker, which is an \"X\" with the word \"Home\" next to it.\nClicking on the Home Location Legend with the center mouse button makes the marker editable; drag the \"X\" or click with the right mouse button to change its location. When the Home Marker is displayed, use the Sample feature (clock and hold while moving the pointer around the screen) to display the range in miles and azimuth (in degrees) of the pointer location relative to the Home location.\n\n\nPoints\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Points option initially displays a circular 10-point pattern, labeled A through J on the Map display. Points are used to generate model soundings, time-height cross-sections, time series, and variable vs. height plots using the Volume Browser. As with the Baselines, the locations of these Points can be edited in the following manner:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Snapping\" an Interactive Point\n: If you are zoomed in over an area when you load Interactive\nPoints and no Points appear, click the right mouse button to \"snap\" a Point to where the mouse cursor is positioned. The system chooses a Point that has not been recently used. If you are currently working with a Point, then a second right mouse button click will place another Point at the location of your cursor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Reference Map\n: When you generate a model sounding, a time-height cross-section, a\ntime series, or a variable vs. height plot, a small reference map indicating the location(s) of the\nplotted sounding(s) is provided in the upper left corner of the Main Display Pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints may be created, deleted, hidden, and manipulated (location, name, font, and color). Points are not limited in terms of number, location, or designation. Points may also be assigned to different groups to facilitate their use. Once the Points tools have been loaded, the addition, deletion, or manipulation of Points can be accomplished in three ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Point Dialog Box\n: The Create Point dialog box is opened by clicking and holding the right mouse button on the map (but not on any exisiting Point) and selecting the \"New Point...\" option.\n\n\nThe Create Point dialog box opens with the Lat and Lon text boxes populated with the latitude\nand longiture values at the point where you had clicked the right mouse button. The latitude and longitude values can be viewed in \"Degrees : Minutes : Seconds,\" \"Degrees : Minutes,\" or \"Degrees Only\" (N and S refer to North and South; W and E refer to West and East).\n\n\nIn the Create Point dialog box, you must:\n\n\n\n\nEnter the Point's name\n\n\nModify the latitude and longitude values\n\n\nAssign the Point's color and font use\n\n\nAssign the Point to a group\n\n\nSelect whether the Point is movable or hidden\n\n\n\n\nBy default, individual Points do not have an assigned color. They inherit the color\nof the Interactive Points layer reflected in the Interactive Points product legend. You can\nchange the color of the Interactive Points layer by right clicking on the Interactive Points\nproduct legend and selecting a color from the dropdown list. The selected color then\nchanges all points not having an assigned color to the new color.\n\n\nPoints can be assigned to \"\n,\" which will organize them in the root location containing the group names when accessed by the Edit Points dialog box (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit Point Dialog Box\n: The Edit Point dialog box is opened by clicking and holding the right mouse button on a Point on the map and selecting the \"Edit Point...\" option. The latitude and longitude values can be viewed in \"Degrees : Minutes : Seconds,\" \"Degrees : Minutes,\" or \"Degrees Only\" (N and S refer to North and South; W and E refer to West and East).\n\n\nBesides the option of selecting the Edit Points dialog box, you also have the option\nof selecting \"Hide Point,\" \"Delete Point,\" or \"Move Point.\" Once hidden, the Point can be\nunhidden using the Points List dialog box, where you would uncheck the checkbox under\nthe \"Hidden\" column adjacent to the Point that was hidden (see below). If \"Delete Point\" is\nselected, a pop-up opens to confirm whether you want to delete the Point. Selecting the\n\"Move Point\" option moves the Point to wherever you place the cursor on the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints List Dialog Box\n: The Points List dialog box is opened by clicking and holding the right mouse button on the Interactive Points product legend and selecting the \"Edit Points...\" option.\n\n\nThe Points List dialog box lists all the available groups and Points. Groups can be expanded to\nreview the list of Points assigned to that group by clicking the arrow next to the group name.\nInitially, the default set of Points (A-J) are listed in the D2D Group, as shown above. In the\nPoints List dialog box, Points and groups may be dragged into and out of other groups to create\nor disassemble subgroups. The Points List dialog box also includes three columns.\n\n\n\n\nPoint Name\n: Lists the group name and designated Points.\n\n\nMovable\n: Checking the checkbox adjacent to the Point disables the Point from being\nmoved.\n\n\nHidden\n: Checking the checkbox adjacent to the Point hides the Point on the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut home cursor\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Put home cursor tool provides an easy way to locate a METAR observation station, a city and\nstate, or a latitude/longitude coordinate. For Canada and Mexico, only the METAR observation stations and latitude/longitude coordinates are accessible. When you select Put home cursor from the Tools dropdown menu, the Home marker X is displayed and the Put Home Cursor dialog box opens.\n\n\nYou can use the Home marker, as previously described in the Home Tool, and the new Home location\n(station, city/state, or latitude/longitude) is identified in the Put Home Cursor dialog box.\nAnother way to use this tool is to type in the station, city and state, or latitude and longitude, and select Go, or hit Enter on the keypad, to move the Home marker to the specified location. The new location's nearest METAR site, city and state, and latitude and longitude appear in the Put Home Cursor dialog box. The Put Home Cursor dialog box contains the following options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation Selection\n: There are three ways to find a desired location. Once you choose the\nStation, City/State, or Lat/Lon radio button, an Entry Box is activated next to the respective label within the Put Home Cursor dialog box. Enter the desired location information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo\n: This menu button initiates the search for the desired station, city/state, or latitude/longitude. The Home marker jumps to the newly specified location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRange Rings\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Range Rings Tool displays adjustable range rings around locations of interest to your local office. When you select Range Rings from the Tools dropdown menu, the Range Rings legend appears in the Main Display Pane. The tool comes up editable, and the rangeRing dialog box opens. (Clicking B2 over the legend toggles tool editability and closes/opens the rangeRing dialog box.) Within this dialog box, you can toggle on/off any of the target locations using the square selectors. Adjust the size of the radii (in nautical miles) by typing a new value in the entry boxes associated with each location and pressing the Apply button. You can also add labels at the center of the range ring and/or at any of the radial distances using the Labels Options menu associated with each location. Using the Movable Rings, you can add a new location at a specific point by using the Interactive Points Tool, or by typing in latitude/longitude coordinates. There is no practical limit on the number of new locations you can add to the display. The list of locations is pre-set but can be customized at a field site\n\n\n\n\nSunset/Sunrise\n\uf0c1\n\n\nBy typing a date, as well as the latitude and longitude of a location into the Sunrise/Sunset Tool dialog box, you can obtain the time (for any time zone) of sunrise and sunset, as well as the total length of daylight for that date. Additional features include the ability to calculate the sunrise/sunset in a different hemisphere, and the azimuthal angles, relative to true north, of the sunrise and sunset.\n\n\n\n\nText Window\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelecting this option brings up a Text Display window that behaves in the same way, except for scripts, as a window on the Text Workstation.\n\n\nUnits Calculator\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis tool converts the units of the first column into differing units of the second column. The units are grouped into temperature, velocity, distance, time, and atmospheric pressure. First, simply type the number and select the units of the value you wish to convert in the firstcolumn entry box. Then in the second column, select the desired units to which you want the original value converted. The new value will appear in the second column entry box.\n\n\n\n\nText Workstation\n\uf0c1",

Only data that matches a pattern in the distribution file will be processed.\n\n\nThe contents of the base version of the radar distribution file:\n\n\n[root@edex]# cd /awips2/edex/data/utility/edex_static/base/distribution/\n[root@edex]# tail -4 radar.xml\n\n\nrequestPatterns xmlns:ns2=\"group\"\n\n    \nregex\n^SDUS[234578]. .*\n/regex\n\n    \nregex\n^RadarServer.*\n/regex\n\n\n/requestPatterns\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the base radar.xml distribution file in the previous example, there are two regular expressions.  The first regular expression matches the standard WMO ID of radar products.   Via the edexBridge the LDM will place a message in the external.dropbox QPID queue, indicating a radar product has arrived.  EDEX will then take the message containing the radar WMO ID and compare it against the regular expressions in radar.xml.  If a match is found, EDEX places a message in the QPID queue Ingest.radar.  The radar decoder will then consume the message and process the radar data accordingly. \n\n\nAdding a REGEX to the Satellite Data Distribution File\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs a quick example, suppose we have a local data source for satellite imagery that does not have a WMO header; also suppose that the data source writes to files whose names start with \nLOCAL.sat\n.\n\n\nTo add this locally produced satellite data file to the EDEX distribution; perform the following steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the base version of \nsatellite.gini.xml\n from the base distribution directory \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/edex_static/base/distribution\n into the site distribution directory \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/edex_static/site/XXX/distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the site version of \nsatellite.xml\n, adding a new \nregex\n/regex\n tag immediately below the existing regular expression (\nregex\n/regex\n) tag. The contents of the tag will be \nLOCAL.sat\n. The final result will be:\n\n\nrequestPatterns xmlns:ns2=\"group\"\n\n    \nregex\nTI[CGT]... ....\n/regex\n\n    \nregex\n.*NEXRCOMP.*\n/regex\n\n    \nregex\n^LOCAL.sat.*\n/regex\n\n\n/requestPatterns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the file and exit the editor. EDEX will automatically pick up the new distribution pattern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw files are written to \n/data_store\n, and a message is sent via QPID to the EDEX distribution service from the LDM. When a regular expression match is found in a data distribution file, the raw data file is placed in a queue for the matching plugin to decode and process. The distribution files are used to match file headers as well as filenames, which is how files dropped into EDEX's manual endpoint (\n/awips2/data_store/ingest\n) are processed.\n\n\nEditing an EDEX Data Distribution File\n\uf0c1\n\n\nBecause these files are in the \nedex_static/\n directory, they have to be manually edited using a text editor. You should not edit the base files; rather, you should copy the base version to your site and then edit the site version. The regular expressions in the distribution files need to correspond with the regular expressions in the LDM \npqact.conf\n \nfile.\n\n\nIf patterns exist in \npqact.conf\n but are not in the distribution files, then raw data files will be written to \n/data_store\n but will not be ingested and processed by EDEX. Entries for these non-ingested files would be written to the unrecognized files log in \n/awips/edex/logs\n.\n\n\nExamples\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSurface Obs\n\uf0c1\n\n\n/awips2/edex/data/utility/edex_static/base/distribution/obs.xml\n Processes any file header that starts with \nSA\n or \nSP\n, which should match any WMO header that contains METAR data (e.g.\nSAUS\n, \nSPUS\n, \nSACN\n, \nSAMX\n).\n\n\nrequestPatterns xmlns:ns2=\"group\"\n\n  \nregex\n^S[AP].*\n/regex\n\n\n/requestPatterns\n\n\n\n\nText Data\n\uf0c1\n\n\n/awips2/edex/data/utility/edex_static/base/distribution/text.xml\n Processes lots of WM patterns.

EDEX will automatically pick up the new distribution pattern.    Raw files are written to  /data_store , and a message is sent via QPID to the EDEX distribution service from the LDM. When a regular expression match is found in a data distribution file, the raw data file is placed in a queue for the matching plugin to decode and process. The distribution files are used to match file headers as well as filenames, which is how files dropped into EDEX's manual endpoint ( /awips2/data_store/ingest ) are processed.",

These data sets include METAR, Maritime, and Local. The Obs menu is subdivided into sections that contain related products. These sections are described below.\n\n\nMETAR\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section contains automatically updating METAR observations, ceiling and visibility plots, wind chill and heat indices, precipitation plots at various time intervals, and quality-checked MSAS observations. The 24hr Chg METAR plot provides the difference between the observed temperature, dewpoint, pressure, and wind from those observed 24 hours earlier. The calculation of the wind difference involves vector subtraction of the \"u\" and \"v\" components.\n\n\nSynoptic\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section contains automatically updating Synoptic observations, and 6 hour and 24 hour precip plots. Note that this section of the menu is not present at most sites.\n\n\nMaritime\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section contains buoy and ship report plots, plus SAFESEAS for the Marine WFOs.\n\n\n\n\nMAROB\n displays include Station Plots\n\n\nThe \nOther Maritime Plots\n cascading menu contains options to display the Fixed and Moving Sea State plots, MAROB Sea State and Cloud/Vis plots, Maritime Clouds/Visibility plots, as well as the Scatterometer Winds.\n\n\nSea State\n plots provide information on the wave period and height and swell period and height. The wave type, whether a standard wave or a wind wave, is denoted at the origin of the plot by a \"+\" or a \"w\", respectively. An \"x\" at the plot origin signifies that no wave type was reported. If reported, the directions of the primary and secondary swells are denoted with arrows labeled \"1\" and \"2\", respectively. The arrows point in the direction the swell is moving.\n\n\nMaritime Clouds/Visibility\n plots contain a station circle denoting sky coverage and the visibility along with standard symbols for obstructions to visibility.\n\n\nScatterometer Winds\n are obtained from the ASCAT instrument on EUMETSAT's MetOp-A polar orbiting satellite. This instrument sends pulses of radiation to the ocean surface and measures the amount of energy, called backscatter, it receives back. When you sample these observations, the time, satellite ID, wind direction, and wind speed are provided. With the polar orbiting scanning, a given region will generally be sampled about every 12 hours. ASCAT Winds (25 km retrieval resolution but interpolated and displayed at 12.5 km resolution) can be launched from either the CAVE Obs menu or from the Satellite menu You can access the Scatterometer Winds menu options by selecting \nSurface\n \n \nOther Maritime Plots\n \n \nScatterometer Winds\n.

Hemisphere, North America, CONUS, Regional, State(s), and WFO.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocal Storm Reports\n: Local Storm Report (LSR) plots are generated from spotter reports\nthat were entered into the LSR text database and decoded into the correct point data format. The LSR graphical user interface (GUI) is a stand-alone AWIPS application designed to provide forecasters with an easy and quick way to create, manage, and send the LSR public text product. This text product contains noteworthy weather events for which the forecaster has either received or sought out real-time observations.\n\n\n\n\nNational Convective Weather Forecast (AWC)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe \nNational Convective Weather Forecast\n (NCWF) is an automatically generated depiction of current convection and extrapolated significant current convection.  It is a supplement to, but does not substitute for, the report and forecast information contained in \nConvective SIGMETs\n. The NCWF contains both GRIB and BUFR output. The GRIB output delineates the current convection. The BUFR output includes hazardous convection area polygons, movement arrows, and storm top and speed text information.\n\n\nThe NCWF display bunlde renders \nstorm tops and movement\n, \nprevious performance polygons\n, \n1-hour extrapolation polygons\n, and \ncurrent convective interest grid\n (colorbar).\n\n\n\n\nCenter Weather Advisories (CWA)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe \nCWA\n is an aviation weather warning for conditions meeting or approaching national in-flight advisory (AIRMET, SIGMET or SIGMET for convection) criteria. The CWA is primarily used by air crews to anticipate and avoid adverse weather conditions in the en route and terminal environments. It is not a flight planning product because of its short lead time and duration.\n\n\nShown with NEXRAD DHR composite:\n\n\n\n\nMOS Products\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThese plots are derived from the MOS BUFR Bulletins. The previous MOS plots were derived from the MOS Text Bulletins. The plots display forecast data for GFS MOS, GFS-Extended MOS, and NGM MOS. Submenus under each model reveal the element choices. These displays include:\n\n\n\n\nStation Model Plots (Wind, T, Td, Sky Cover, Wx)\n\n\nMaxT/MinT (\u00b0F)\n\n\nCeiling (agl) / Visibility (ft \u00d7 100) (Categorical)\n\n\nProbabilities Submenu (6h/12h PoP, 6h/12h Tstorm, 6h/12h Svr-Tstorm, Conditional precipitation types; %)\n\n\nQPF 12h (Categorical mid-points; inches)\n\n\nQPF 6h (Categorical mid-points; inches)\n\n\nSnowfall (6h/12h/24h, Categorical; inches)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLightning\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis menu item provides three options for displaying lightning flash plots over specified 1 minute, 5 minute, 15 minute and 1 hour intervals.\n\n\n\n\nUSPLN (United States Precision Lightning Network)\n: WSI Corporation USPLN lightning data has been made available exclusively to universities for education and research use.  Unidata serves USPLN lightning stroke data from the \nLIGHTNING\n LDM data feed. Registration is required to request this data, and the free feed is available on an annually renewed basis. USPLN data is not available to the public.\n\n\nNLDN (National Lightning Detection Network)\n: The NLDN option plots cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flashes for specified time intervals across the continental United States. NLDN lightning data can be displayed as a grid image displaying the cloud-to-ground density values for a selected resolution (1km, 3km, 5km, 8km, 20km, and 40km).\n\n\nGLD (Global Lightning Dataset)\n: The GLD option plots cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning flashes for specified time intervals on a global-scale.

CF lightning are lightning flashes which do not strike the ground such as in-cloud, cloud-to-cloud, and cloud-to-air lightning. Lightning pulses are electromagnetic pulses that radiate outward from the lightning channel.

VIIRS' mission is to collect radiometric imagery in visible and infrared wavelengths of the Earth's surface; this includes observing fires, ice, ocean color, vegetation, clouds, and land and sea surface temperatures, and supplying high-resolution images and data used by meteorologists to assess climate change and improve short-term weather forecasting.\n\n\nThe VIIRS submenu option provides VIIRS imagery and moderate band satellite displays for the\nCONUS, Alaska, and Pacific regions.  In addition to accessing the NPP Product VIIRS data via the Satellite menu, the VIIRS Imagery data can also be accessed using the \nProduct Browser\n.\n\n\nGOES and POES Sounding Data\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGOES and POES Sounding Data Availability Plots displays the locations where GOES and POES temperature and moisture profiles are available. These soundings are displayed on a Skew-T/log P chart using the Points tool and the Volume Browser. Soundings from the GOES satellites are made only in relatively cloud-free areas, whereas POES systems produce temperature and moisture soundings in clear and cloudy atmospheres. Each hour, NESDIS provides the latest soundings from GOES East and West. Although the GOES East and West sounders yield soundings over a broad area, the default AWIPS configuration retains soundings only from within each site's Regional CAVE scale domain. POES soundings are generated approximately every 12 hours and have more global coverage.\n\n\nPOES Imagery\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe POES Imagery section of the Satellite menu contains selectors for IR Window, Visible, 3.7\u00b5, and 11-3.7\u00b5 products. These are viewable on all scales.\n\n\nSounder Imagery\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe products available from the Sounder Imagery submenu are based purely on the imager instruments aboard the GOES East (GE) and GOES West (GW) satellites.\n\n\nDerived Products Imagery\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA variety of precipitation products are accessible from the Derived Products submenu. These products are derived from one or more of the various satellites (e.g., DMPS, POES, GOES, and GPS). Descriptions of the products follow.\n\n\nThe Blended Rain Rate (formerly Rainfall Rate) product is produced hourly to gather recent rain rate retrievals from passive microwave instruments on six polar-orbiting satellites. The blended rain rate eliminates the bias between those data sets and provides a unified, meteorologically significant rain rate field to weather forecasters.\n\n\nThe GOES products derived from the GOES satellite include Lifted Index, Total Precip Water (TPW), Cloud Amount, Cloud Top Height, Skin Temperature, and Low Cloud Base. Because the imagery from these products is based on the GOES sounder instrument, several important differences exist between these products and the other (imager-based) imagery. The main differences are that the resolution is no finer than 10 km, the product update frequency is driven by the sounder instrument (AWIPS receives a set of GOES East/West composite derived product images once per hour), and the aerial coverage is based on that of the sounder scans, which is somewhat less than the aerial coverage provided by the imager. Descriptions of the products follow.\n\n\n\n\nLifted Index\n is a common measure of instability. Its value is obtained by computing the temperature that air near the ground would have if it were lifted to some higher level (usually around 18,000 feet), and comparing that temperature to the actual temperature at that level. The more negative the value, the more instability there is.\n\n\nTotal Precip Water\n is the vertically integrated water vapor content in a column extending from the earth's surface to the top of the atmosphere.\n\n\nCloud Amount\n provides an hourly update of cloud amounts within a geostationary satellite field of view. You can loop through the display to identify increasing/decreasing cloud conditions and trends.\n\n\nCloud Top Height\n is the height of the cloud in thousands of feet (base - top). Skin Temperature is the sea surface temperature of the ocean surface water.\n\n\nLow Cloud Base\n provides nighttime images of fog and low stratus clouds derived from a combination of two GOES IR channels. This product identifies cloud ceilings of \n1000 feet and is generated hourly starting between 2042 and 2142 GMT, and ending between 1510 and 1610 GMT the next day. This product is beneficial to the warning and forecast processes specific to aviation and terminal forecasting\n\n\n\n\nThe Total Precip Water (TPW) value can also be derived from the data sources of DMSP, SSM/I (Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Special Sensor Microwave / Imager), and POES AMSU (POES Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit) satellites, which are accessed from the DMSP SSM/I, and POES AMSU sections of the submenu.\n\n\nVariations of TPW (\"Blended Total Precip Water\" and \"Percent of Normal TPW\") are selectable\nunder the AMSU and SSM/I + GPS section.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nBlended Total Precip Water\n product is a blend of the various data sources of AMSU,\nSSM/I, and GPS satellites, and can be over water or land.\n\n\nThe Percent of Normal TPW\n product is calculated at various times (hourly, monthly,\nseasonally, etc.) to determine departures from the normal. From the information obtained,\nforecasters can predict the chances of having a below average, normal, or above average\nprecipitation in the upcoming months.\n\n\n\n\nSSM/I Point Data\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSSM/I Point Data plot displays data collected over the course of a day for calculating ocean wind speeds.\n\n\nGOES High Density Winds\n\uf0c1\n\n\nGOES High Density Winds submenu has options to display satellite-derived multi-layer winds plots from the IR, Visible, and three Water Vapor channels. In addition, you can display individual layers that display a composite of all the satellite channels.\n\n\nMTSAT High Density Winds\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMTSAT High Density Winds cover the Western Pacific.\n\n\nASCAT winds (25 km)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nScatterometer Winds are obtained from the ASCAT instrument on EUMETSAT's MetOP-A polar orbiting satellite. This instrument sends pulses of radiation to the ocean surface and measures the amount of energy, called backscatter, it receives back. When you sample these observations, the time, satellite ID, wind direction, and wind speed are provided. With the polar orbiting scanning, a given region will generally be sampled about every 12 hours.\n\n\nASCAT winds (25 km retrieval resolution but interpolated and displayed at 12.5 km resolution) are launchable from both the CAVE Satellite menu and the Upper Air menu. The ASCAT instrument generates ocean surface wind retrievals. The ASCAT Scatterometer Ocean Winds product is displayable on\nCAVE at all scales.",

Primary dual-pol base data analysis is best accomplished using the \nAll Tilts base data\n option (4 panel all tilts with 8 products loaded), though you may use the single tilts (e.g., 0.5 base data) for longer time duration loops.\n\n\nTo load 4 panel displays containing multiple elevation angles of the same product, you would\nselect the \nfour panel\n option and then select the desired set of 4 panels from the \nfour\npanel\n submenu.\n\n\n\n\nAll Tilts allows you to step or animate in either space or time.

For example, assume the \nUP ARROW\n or \nDOWN ARROW\n key is pressed; the menu controls will now operate through the tilts at a fixed time, e.g., you can go to the lowest tilt by selecting the First Frame iconified button.\n\n\nBest Res Base Products\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section is divided into two parts. The upper part lists individual products: four base products and three dual-pol products (ZDR, CC, and KDP). The lower part includes submenus for accessing multiple products and applications. The following describes the submenus grouped in the lower part of the Best Res Base Products section.\n\n\n\n\nPrecip\n: In addition to the QPE dual-pol products, this submenu includes the legacy precip products, which include Storm Total, One Hour, Three Hour, and User Selectable precipitation products. A suite of snowfall products is also available on the \nPrecip\n submenu. All are available for request (OTR, RMR), and the first four can be added to an RPS (Routine Product Set) list. All of these products are available on any scale.\n\n\nDerived Products\n: The Derived Products submenu includes Layer Reflectivity, Cross Section, and Other products displayed on any scale. Derived products include precipitation, storm (mesocyclone, hail, tornado), and wind derivations.\n\n\nAlgorithm Overlays\n: The Algorithm Overlays submenu includes legacy algorithm overlays and the ML dual-pol overlay.\n\n\nfour panel\n: The four panel submenu includes menu entries for Z+V, Z+SRM 8- and 4-bit, and some other combinations that are presented in 4-panel mode, with a different elevation angle or product in each panel.\n\n\nData Quality\n: The Data Quality products, accessible by a pull-right submenu, include Clutter Filter Control and reflectivity and velocity clutter probability products.\n\n\n4-bit/Legacy Prods\n: The 4-bit/Legacy Prods submenu uses generic selectors that load 8-bit (256 level) data, with legacy 4-bit (16 level) and 3-bit (8 level) data filling in when no 8-bit data is available.\n\n\nRadar Applications\n: The Radar Applications submenu provides access to all the radar applications and radar tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMRMS\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nFNEXRAD Composites\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDHR\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nDLV\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nEET\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nHHC\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nDAA\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nDTA\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMosaic Radar Plots\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMosaics available via this menu use data from up to nine nearby radars. Additional optional\nmosaics on cascading menus provide a limited list of radar products from a predefined set of WSR-88D radars within a given region. Your System Manager or site Administrator can set up such mosaics by: \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/site/\nSITE\n/radar/radarInUse.txt\n. A mosaicInfo.txt table will only work while logged on to an AWIPS workstation.\n\n\nN0Q\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDSP\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDTA\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDAA\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nRadar Applications\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEstimated Actual Velocity (EAV)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA velocity (V) display from the radar shows only the radial component of the wind, so the indicated\nspeed depends on the direction of the wind and the azimuth (direction) from the radar. Consider, for example, a north wind. Straight north of the radar, the full speed of the wind will be seen on the V product. As one moves around to the east of the radar, the radial component gets smaller, eventually reaching zero straight east of the radar. If the wind direction is known, then the actual wind speed can be computed by dividing the observed radial speed by the cosine of the angle between the radar radial and the actual direction. The EAV tool allows you to provide that angle and use the sampling function of the display to show the actual wind speed.\n\n\n\n\nFour-dimensional Stormcell Investigator (FSI)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe \nFour-dimensional Stormcell Investigator (FSI)\n was developed by the National Severe Storms Laboratory for its Warning Decision Support System Integrated Information.  This technology allows users to create and manipulate dynamic cross-sections (both vertical and at constant altitude), such that one can \u201cslice and dice\u201d storms and view these data in three-dimensions and across time.\n\n\nV-R Shear\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis tool is used in conjunction with Doppler velocity data to calculate the velocity difference (or \"shear\") of the data directly under the end points. As with the Baselines, this feature comes up editable and the end points can be dragged to specific gates of velocity data. When in place, the speed difference (kts), distance between end points (nautical miles), shear (s-1), and distance from radar (Nmi) are automatically plotted next to the end points and in the upper left corner of the Main Display Pane. A positive shear value indicates cyclonic shear, while a negative value indicates anticyclonic shear. If either end point is not directly over velocity data, the phrase \"no data\" is reported for the shear value. This tool is also useful in determining gate-to-gate shear. Simply place the two end points directly over adjacent gates of velocity data.\n\n\n\n\n\"Snapping\" VR Shear\n: If you are zoomed in over an area when you load VR - Shear, and the VR - Shear Baseline does not appear, click B3 to \"snap\" the Baseline to where the mouse cursor\nis located.\n\n\nVR - Shear in 4 Panel\n: You can use the VR - Shear Tool when the large display is in 4 panel\nmode. The VR - Shear overlay is loaded in different colors for each panel. There are actually\nfour copies of the program running, and each behaves independently. This means that you can\nget accurate readings in any one of the four panels \u2014 one VR - Shear panel is editable at a time. To activate, click B2 on the VR - Shear legend in the desired panel and position the query line to\nthe echoes of interest.",

The HPC product will update the selected forecast cycle twice per day.\n\n\nTemps \n Weather\n Contains daily Max/Min temperature anomalies, daily heat index\nprobabilities, and pressure and frontal analysis.\n\n\n\n\nMPC\n\uf0c1\n\n\nContains the Marine Guidance submenu, which includes marine analyses and model guidance. Note that  the Marine Prediction Center (MPC) is now called the Ocean Prediction Center (OPC).\n\n\nCPC\n\uf0c1\n\n\nContains threat charts and outlook grids derived from these two submenus:\n\n\n\n\nThreat Charts\n Contains drought monitoring data, daily threats assessment, and daily heat index forecasts.\n\n\nOutlook Grids\n Contains temperature and precipitation probabilities.\n\n\n\n\nAWC\n\uf0c1\n\n\nContains CCFP (Collaborative Convective Forecast Product), an aviation product. Formerly located under the Aviation option on the Upper Air menu, CCFP is a strategic forecast of convection to guide traffic managers in their system-wide approach to managing traffic. The forecast suite consists of 3 forecast maps with selectable lead times (4, 6, and 8 hours). The forecasts are issued by the Aviation Weather Center (AWC) between March 1 and October 30, eleven times per day.\n\n\nCCFP is alpha-numeric information suitable for the graphical depiction of forecast areas of significant thunderstorms. The CCFP message covers the CONUS area, and includes information on the location of thunderstorm areas, and associated information such as storm tops, coverage, confidence, and direction/speed of movement.\n\n\nNCO\n\uf0c1\n\n\nContains Precip \n Stability, Temps \n Weather, National Centers model, NGM MOS (NGM-based MOS system), and the following Sounding-derived plots submenus.\n\n\n\n\nPrecip \n Stability\n: Contains precipitation, radar, and stability products.\n\n\nTemps \n Weather\n: Contains Max/Min temperature, freezing level, weather depiction, and surface geostrophic wind and relative vorticity plots.\n\n\nNational Centers Models\n: Contains model guidance from the National Centers\n\n\nSounding-derived plots\n: Contains options to display model soundings (sometimes called \"BUFR soundings\" because they are packaged in BUFR format for transmission). These are soundings extracted directly from the model, including all levels not generated from the pressure-level grids used elsewhere in the system.\n\n\nSounding Availability\n This option displays the sounding locations (shown with asterisks) available from the latest model run; typically these locations coincide with TAF (Terminal Aerodrome Forecast) locations. The plot will update with each model run. Because the sounding data is quite voluminous, only soundings over your State(s) scale are saved.\n\n\nSurface\n The Surface Plots, which mimic the METAR Surface Plots, are taken from the model-derived soundings and provide hourly forecast surface plots. Because you cannot see all forecast projections in a 32 frame loop (e.g., displaying the entire North American Model (NAM) or Global Forecasting System (GFS) run would require 61 frames), you will probably want to use the Time Options Tool (refer to Subsection 2.2.6.4) to view a subset of the forecast -- perhaps a continuous run of hours or every other hour for the whole run.\n\n\nCeiling/Visibility\n The \"Ceil/Vis Plot\" shows weather (rain, frz rain, snow) on the right, a stack of three cloud layers above, and visibility below the METAR station. The cloud layers are defined as low (990mb-640mb), mid (640mb-350mb), and high (\n350mb). Each cloud layer shows a coverage circle with clear, sct, bkn, and ovc options. Next to one of the circles, there may be a cloud base. The cloud base is sent as a pressure, but is plotted in hft MSL based on a Standard Atmosphere conversion. Because the cloud layers and the cloud base are generated from separate algorithms at NCEP (National Centers for Environmental Prediction), it is possible to have broken or overcast clouds indicated but no base; alternatively, the base may be shown with a high overcast, while ignoring a mid broken layer. Also, a cloud base is reported if convective precipitation is indicated, even for only 10-20% cloud cover. As a result, one can see a cloud base associated with scattered clouds.\n\n\n1 Hr and 3 Hr Precip Amt\n This option shows hourly amounts for NAM and 3 hour intervals for GFS at each location.\n\n\nCloud Layers\n This option displays the amount of low, middle, and high cloud cover, each as a standard sky coverage symbol, and weather type as a weather symbol.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHydro\n\uf0c1\n\n\nContains QPE, QPF, and RFC Flash Flood Guidance submenus. Hydro Applications, such as HydroView and MPE Editor, are loaded from the Perspectives dialog (Hydro and MPE, respectively) or from the HydroApps menu in the Hydro(View) Perspective (Hydrobase, RiverPro, XDAT, Forecast Service, River Monitor, Precip Monitor, SSHP, and Dam Catalog).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQPE\n: Makes available mosaic images of RFC-generated Quantitative Precipitation Estimator (QPE) and the Multisensor Precipitation Estimator (MPE) grids, which are displayed using a 'truncated' grid color table that shows zero values in gray to let you see the limits of the site-specified domain. These mosaic images are generated by the RFCs in 1, 6, and 24 hour cycles. The MPE grids can be displayed as local contours or images.\n\n\n\n\nNESDIS\n produces two types of Satellite Precipitation Estimates (SPE) based on GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) imagery series: Auto SPEs and Manual SPEs. Auto SPEs, which can be displayed directly from the QPE submenu, are produced hourly based on the most recent one-hour series of IR GOES imagery. This product is displayable on any AWIPS scale. The Auto SPE estimates are displayed in units of inches of precipitation that fell during the specified one hour period.\n\n\nManual SPEs\n are accessible through the Manual SPE submenu. You can access the Manual SPE submenu from the QPE submenu. Generation of these products requires substantial manual intervention by NESDIS personnel; consequently, these products are generated and distributed to AWIPS at variable frequencies, as significant precipitation events warrant (i.e., their frequency is variable). The duration (or valid period) of the Manual SPEs is also variable. Whereas the duration of Auto SPEs is always one hour, the duration of the Manual SPEs ranges from 1 to 12 hours. Furthermore, although each Manual SPE product is mapped to a CONUS grid, the area of analysis is usually regional (focusing on the significant precipitation event). Apart from these important differences, the Manual SPEs are very similar to the Auto SPEs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQPF\n: Displays QPF, which indicate how much precipitation will occur in a particular grid. QPFs, which are issued by the RFCs, display as contours by default. However, from the pop-up menu you can convert them to image form.\n\n\n\n\nRFC Flash Flood Guidance\n: Displays County and Zone Flash Flood Guidance (FFG) grids on any scale. The area for which the data is displayed is limited, but the site system manager may configure a larger area. In addition, 1h, 3h, and 6h mosaic RFC-generated FFG grids can be displayed for both local and other RFC locations.\n\n\n\n\nLocal Analyses/Statistical Guidance\n\uf0c1\n\n\nModel Output Statistical (MOS) plots derived from the MOS BUFR and Text Bulletins display forecast data for GFS MOS, GFS-Extended MOS, Eta MOS, and NGM MOS. The plots are accessed by selecting NGM or GFS-LAMP/MOS forecasts under the Local Analyses/Statistical Guidance option.",
