This directory contains scripts to handle the upgrade from PostgreSQL 9.5.x to
9.6.x. All of these scripts MUST be kept together in one directory for them
to work.

There are two parts to this install: Steps to be done BEFORE installing
the new PostgreSQL RPM packages (awips2-postgresql and awips2-psql), and steps
to be done AFTER installing those packages. All scripts must be run as root.

If the server to be upgraded is part of a streaming replication setup, see
the NOTE FOR STREAMING REPLICATION SETUP at the end of this document.


INSTRUCTIONS - BEFORE INSTALLING ANY RPMS:

1. Shut down PostgreSQL if it is not already.

2. Run postgres_pre_upgrade.sh. This script confirms that the installed version
   of PostgreSQL is the expected one, and copies the existing PostgreSQL
   installation to /awips2/postgresql-9.5.23. This copy is required for the
   upgrade. (When the PostgreSQL cluster upgrade completes, this directory will
   be moved to /awips2/postgresql-9.5.23_done)


INSTRUCTIONS - AFTER INSTALLING RPMS:

1. BEFORE starting PostgreSQL, run upgrade_postgresql_database.sh. Check the
   end of the output for "UPGRADE COMPLETE". Do not interrupt the script while
   it is running, as this may prevent proper cleanup.  This string will appear
   only if the upgrade was successful.

2. Run rebuild_stats.sh. This must be done while PostgreSQL is running. This
   script is separate from the previous step because it takes longer to run. It
   can/should be run while EDEX or other users of the database are running, to
   limit downtime.

3. If all previous steps have completed successfully and PostgreSQL is not
   producing errors, you can delete the old PostgreSQL install located at
   /awips2/postgresql-9.5.23_done


NOTE FOR STREAMING REPLICATION SETUP:

In a streaming replication setup where there is one master PostgreSQL server
and multiple standby servers that replicate from it, the process is as follows:

1. Stop all PostgreSQL servers in the topology.
2. Upgrade the master using the above instructions.
3. Start up the master PostgreSQL server.
4. Re-create each standby server by following the directions in
   /awips2/database/replication/README, under the section SETTING UP STANDBYS.
