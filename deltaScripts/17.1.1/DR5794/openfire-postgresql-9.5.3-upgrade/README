This directory contains scripts to handle the upgrade from PostgreSQL 9.3.x to
9.5.x, for servers running Openfire.

*** IMPORTANT: If you are upgrading a server that does NOT run openfire, do
NOT use these scripts. Use the scripts in the directory "DR5737" instead.

There are two parts to this install: Steps to be done BEFORE installing
the new PostgreSQL RPM packages (awips2-postgresql and awips2-psql), and steps
to be done AFTER installing those packages. All scripts must be run as root.


INSTRUCTIONS - BEFORE INSTALLING ANY RPMS:

1. Stop PostgreSQL if it is not already stopped.

2. Run postgres_pre_upgrade_openfire.sh.


INSTRUCTIONS - AFTER INSTALLING RPMS:

1. BEFORE starting PostgreSQL, run postgres_post_upgrade_openfire.sh. This
script should NOT be run unattended.  Check the end of the output for "UPGRADE
COMPLETE" before continuing.

2. When the upgrade is finished, start PostgreSQL.

3. Run rebuild_stats.sh. This must be done while PostgreSQL is running. To
limit downtime, this script can be run even while EDEX or other users of the
database are running. This script can be run unattended.

4. If all previous steps have completed successfully and PostgreSQL is not
producing errors, you can delete the old PostgreSQL install located at
/awips2/postgresql-9.3.10
