// Each line in eavConfigTable.txt contains up to three space-delimited
// items: an angle, a formatting prefix, and a rounding value. These are
// used to format the EAV display and sample strings.
// If a line does not have a useable angle from 0.0 to 90.0 as the first
// item it will be ignored. It is assumed the lines have increasing angle
// values. A line with less than three items, a rounding value <=0, or an
// angle >MAX_EAV_ANGLE (80 deg; defined in RadarPVImageDepict.C) will be
// treated as the last line, which is used to supply the angle threshold
// and output string for those cases where the direction is too close to
// perpendicular to the radial to allow the algorithm to generate a number.
// A backquote is changed to a space.
