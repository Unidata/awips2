      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      Modification is:

            A. Any addition to or deletion from the contents of a file
            containing Original Code or previous Modifications.

            B. Any new file that contains any part of the Original

      1.12. "You" means an individual or a legal entity exercising
      rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License or a

      claims:

            (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense
            and distribute the Original Code (or portions thereof) with or
            without Modifications, or as part of a Larger Work; and

            (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
            Initial Developer, to make, have made, use and sell ("Utilize") the
            Original Code (or portions thereof), but solely to the extent that
            any such patent is reasonably necessary to enable You to Utilize the
            Original Code (or portions thereof) and not to any greater extent
            that may be necessary to Utilize further Modifications or
            combinations. 

      2.2. Contributor Grant.


      Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,
      non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
      claims:

            (a) to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense and
            distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions
            thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications, as

            (b) under patents now or hereafter owned or controlled by
            Contributor, to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof),
            but solely to the extent that any such patent is reasonably necessary to
            enable You to Utilize the Contributor Version (or portions thereof), and
            not to any greater extent that may be necessary to Utilize further
            Modifications or combinations.

3. Distribution Obligations.

      3.1. Application of License.


      The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute are
      governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation
      Section 2.2. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be
      distributed only under the terms of this License or a future version of
      this License released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
      copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You
      distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code
      version that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
      or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may include an
      additional document offering the additional rights described in Section
      3.5.

      3.2. Availability of Source Code.


      Any Modification which You create or to which You contribute must be
      made available in Source Code form under the terms of this License either
      on the same media as an Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
      Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
      available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism,
      must remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it
      initially became available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent
      version of that particular Modification has been made available to such
      recipients. You are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version
      remains available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
      maintained by a third party.

      3.3. Description of Modifications.


      You must cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a
      file documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the
      date of any change. You must include a prominent statement that the
      Modification is derived, directly or indirectly, from Original Code
      provided by the Initial Developer and including the name of the Initial
      Developer in (a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable
      version or related documentation in which You describe the origin or
      ownership of the Covered Code.

      3.4. Intellectual Property Matters

            (a) Third Party Claims.


            If You have knowledge that a party claims an intellectual
            property right in particular functionality or code (or its
            utilization under this License), you must include a text file with
            the source code distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the
            claim and the party making the claim in sufficient detail that a
            recipient will know whom to contact. If you obtain such knowledge
            after You make Your Modification available as described in Section
            3.2, You shall promptly modify the LEGAL file in all copies
            You make available thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
            notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably
            calculated to inform those who received the Covered Code that new
            knowledge has been obtained.

            (b) Contributor APIs.


            If Your Modification is an application programming interface and
            You own or control patents which are reasonably necessary to
            implement that API, you must also include this information in the
            LEGAL file.

      3.5. Required Notices.


      You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the
      Source Code, and this License in any documentation for the Source Code,
      where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered Code. If You
      created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
      Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A. If it is not
      possible to put such notice in a particular Source Code file due to its
      structure, then you must include such notice in a location (such as a
      relevant directory file) where a user would be likely to look for such a
      notice. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty,
      support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
      Covered Code. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
      behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
      absolutely clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
      obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the
      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
      indemnity or liability terms You offer.

      3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions.


      You may distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the
      requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met for that Covered
      Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code version of
      the Covered Code is available under the terms of this License, including
      a description of how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of
      Section 3.2. The notice must be conspicuously included in any
      notice in an Executable version, related documentation or collateral in
      which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You
      may distribute the Executable version of Covered Code under a license of
      Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
      provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
      that the license for the Executable version does not attempt to limit or
      alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code version from the rights
      set forth in this License. If You distribute the Executable version under
      a different license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
      which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by the
      Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
      Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
      Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
      offer.

      3.7. Larger Works.


      You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
      code not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
      Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
      requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.

      If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
      License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or
      regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to
      the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the
      code they affect. Such description must be included in the LEGAL file
      described in Section 3.4 and must be included with all
      distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent prohibited by
      statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for
      a recipient of ordinary skill
      to be able to understand it.

5. Application of this License.

      This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has attached
      the notice in Exhibit A, and to related Covered Code.

6. Versions of the License.

      6.1. New Versions.


      Netscape Communications Corporation ("Netscape") may publish
      revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each
      version will be given a distinguishing version number.

      6.2. Effect of New Versions.


      Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of
      the License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
      version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of
      any subsequent version of the License published by Netscape. No one other
      than Netscape has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered
      Code created under this License.

      6.3. Derivative Works.


      If you create or use a modified version of this License (which you
      may only do in order to apply it to code which is not already Covered
      Code governed by this License), you must (a) rename Your license so that
      the phrases "Mozilla", "MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "NPL"
      or any confusingly similar phrase do not appear anywhere in your license
      and (b) otherwise make it clear that your version of the license contains
      terms which differ from the Mozilla Public License and Netscape Public
      License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer, Original Code or
      Contributor in the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
      themselves be deemed to be modifications of this License.)

7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

      COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
      WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
      MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE
      RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH
      YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
      INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
      NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
      CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE
      IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

8. TERMINATION.

      This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
      automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
      such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
      sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
      any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
      remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall survive.

9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

      UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
      NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY
      OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF
      ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY
      INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER
      INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
      STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
      COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED
      OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
      NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
      PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
      LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
      OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION
      MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

      The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48
      C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software"
      and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are
      used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212
      and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
      U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set
      forth herein.

11. MISCELLANEOUS.

      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter
      hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
      such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
      enforceable. This License shall be governed by California law provisions
      (except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
      excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With respect to disputes in
      which at least one party is a citizen of, or an entity chartered or
      registered to do business in, the United States of America: (a) unless
      otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to this License
      (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property rights) shall be
      subject to final and binding arbitration, with the losing party paying
      all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration relating to this Agreement
      shall be held in Santa Clara County, California, under the auspices of
      JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation relating to this Agreement shall
      be subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern
      District of California, with venue lying in Santa Clara County,
      California, with the losing party responsible for costs, including
      without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and
      expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
      for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
      regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
      construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

      Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with
      Section 3.4, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or
      indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based
      on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues
      you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You
      agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an
      equitable basis.

	Copyright Notice
	================
	(c) Copyright JPMorgan Chase Bank & Co., Cisco Systems, Inc., Envoy Technologies Inc.,
	iMatix Corporation, IONA\ufffd Technologies, Red Hat, Inc.,
	TWIST Process Innovations, and 29West Inc. 2006. All rights reserved.
	
	License
	=======
	JPMorgan Chase Bank & Co., Cisco Systems, Inc., Envoy Technologies Inc., iMatix 
	Corporation, IONA\ufffd Technologies, Red Hat, Inc., TWIST Process Innovations, and 
	29West Inc. (collectively, the "Authors") each hereby grants to you a worldwide,
	perpetual, royalty-free, nontransferable, nonexclusive license to
	(i) copy, display, and implement the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
	("AMQP") Specification and (ii) the Licensed Claims that are held by
	the Authors, all for the purpose of implementing the Advanced Messaging
	Queue Protocol Specification. Your license and any rights under this
	Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from
	any Author if you bring any claim, suit, demand, or action related to
	the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification against any Author.
	Upon termination, you shall destroy all copies of the Advanced Messaging
	Queue Protocol Specification in your possession or control.
	
	As used hereunder, "Licensed Claims" means those claims of a patent or
	patent application, throughout the world, excluding design patents and
	design registrations, owned or controlled, or that can be sublicensed
	without fee and in compliance with the requirements of this
	Agreement, by an Author or its affiliates now or at any
	future time and which would necessarily be infringed by implementation
	of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification. A claim is
	necessarily infringed hereunder only when it is not possible to avoid
	infringing it because there is no plausible non-infringing alternative
	for implementing the required portions of the Advanced Messaging Queue
	Protocol Specification. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Licensed Claims
	shall not include any claims other than as set forth above even if
	contained in the same patent as Licensed Claims; or that read solely
	on any implementations of any portion of the Advanced Messaging Queue
	Protocol Specification that are not required by the Advanced Messaging
	Queue Protocol Specification, or that, if licensed, would require a
	payment of royalties by the licensor to unaffiliated third parties.
	Moreover, Licensed Claims shall not include (i) any enabling technologies
	that may be necessary to make or use any Licensed Product but are not
	themselves expressly set forth in the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
	Specification (e.g., semiconductor manufacturing technology, compiler
	technology, object oriented technology, networking technology, operating
	system technology, and the like); or (ii) the implementation of other
	published standards developed elsewhere and merely referred to in the
	body of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification, or
	(iii) any Licensed Product and any combinations thereof the purpose or
	function of which is not required for compliance with the Advanced
	Messaging Queue Protocol Specification. For purposes of this definition,
	the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification shall be deemed to
	include both architectural and interconnection requirements essential
	for interoperability and may also include supporting source code artifacts
	where such architectural, interconnection requirements and source code
	artifacts are expressly identified as being required or documentation to
	achieve compliance with the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification.
	
	As used hereunder, "Licensed Products" means only those specific portions
	of products (hardware, software or combinations thereof) that implement
	and are compliant with all relevant portions of the Advanced Messaging
	Queue Protocol Specification.
	
	The following disclaimers, which you hereby also acknowledge as to any
	use you may make of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol Specification:
	
	THE ADVANCED MESSAGING QUEUE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION IS PROVIDED "AS IS,"
	AND THE AUTHORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR
	IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
	FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR TITLE; THAT THE
	CONTENTS OF THE ADVANCED MESSAGING QUEUE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION ARE
	SUITABLE FOR ANY PURPOSE; NOR THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ADVANCED
	MESSAGING QUEUE PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY 
	PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS OR OTHER RIGHTS.
	
	THE AUTHORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
	INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO ANY
	USE, IMPLEMENTATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE ADVANCED MESSAGING QUEUE
	PROTOCOL SPECIFICATION.
	
	The name and trademarks of the Authors may NOT be used in any manner,
	including advertising or publicity pertaining to the Advanced Messaging
	Queue Protocol Specification or its contents without specific, written
	prior permission. Title to copyright in the Advanced Messaging Queue
	Protocol Specification will at all times remain with the Authors.
	
	No other rights are granted by implication, estoppel or otherwise.
	
	Upon termination of your license or rights under this Agreement, you
	shall destroy all copies of the Advanced Messaging Queue Protocol
	Specification in your possession or control.
