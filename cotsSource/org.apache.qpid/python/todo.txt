Key:
  F = Functional
  PF = Partially Functional
  NR = Needs Additional Review
  ND = Needs Additional Design
  NF = Not Functional

Connection:

  variables/configuration:

    - reconnect: F, NR, ND
      + reconnect functionality is done and the API semantics provided
        are ready for review
      + reconnect policies need to be finished, there is currently
        only one hardcoded reconnect policy (retry every three
        seconds), we need to define the pre-canned policies that we
        want to support and a means to configure them, as well as a
        very simple plugin/callback for defining ad-hoc policies
      + need to feed failover exchange into the reconnect policy
      + acks can be lost on reconnect
      + handle reconnect during commit/rollback

    - timeout: NF
      + some sort of timeout threshold for killing the connection

  methods:

    - open/__init__: F, ND
      + need to support kerberos
      + need a better way of supplying various kinds of configuration:
        - authentication info
        - transport specific configuration options, e.g
          - heartbeat
          - socket options
            - tcp-nodelay
        - multiple brokers

    - session: F, NR

    - connect: F, NR

    - disconnect: F, NR

    - connected: F, NR

    - close: F, NR, ND
      + currently there is no distinction between a "close" that does
        a complete handshake with the remote broker, and a "close"
        that reclaims resources, this means that close can fail with
        an exception, I don't like this as it is unclear to the user
        if there is a responsibility to do further cleanup in this
        case

  errors:

    - ConnectionError: F, NR
      + ConnectError F, NR
      + Disconnected F, NR

    - notification of disconnect?

Session:

  methods:

    - sender: F, NR, ND
      + need to detail address options
      + need to define subject pattern semantics
      + consider providing convenience for sender/receiver caching

    - receiver: F, NR, ND
      + need to detail address options
      + need to define filter syntax/semantics
      + consider providing convenience for sender/receiver caching

    - acknowledge: F, NR

    - reject: NF

    - release: NF

    - commit: F, NR

    - rollback: F, NR

    - next_receiver: F, NR

    - close: F, ND
      + see comment on Connection.close

  errors:

    - SessionError: F, NR, ND
      + SendError: F, NR, ND
      + ReceiveError: F, NR, ND
      + should there be fatal/non fatal variants?

Sender:

  methods:

    - pending: F, NR

    - send: F, NR

    - sync: F, NR, ND
      + currently this blocks until pending == 0, I'm thinking of
        renaming this to wait and adding a slightly richer interface
        that would let you wait for something like pending < n

    - close: F, NR

  errors:

    - SendError
      + InsufficientCapacity
      + need specific subhierarchy for certain conditions, e.g. no such queue

Receiver:

  methods:

    - pending: F, NR

    - listen: F, ND
      + see comment on Session.fetch

    - fetch: F, NR, ND
      + explicit grant for receiver
      + changing capacity/prefetch to issue credit on ack rather than
        fetch return

    - sync/wait: NF

    - close: F, NR

  errors:

    - ReceiveError
      + Empty
      + need specific subhierarchy for certain conditions, e.g. no such queue

Message:

  - standard message properties: F, NR, ND

  - map messages: F, NR
    + needs interop testing: NF
    + needs java impl: NF

  - list messages: F, NR, NI
    + needs interop testing: NF
    + needs java impl: NF

  - boxed types: NF

Address:

  - syntax: F, NR
  - subject related changes, e.g. allowing patterns on both ends: NF
  - creating/deleting queues/exchanges F, NR
    + need to handle cleanup of temp queues/topics: F, NR
    + passthrough options for creating exchanges/queues: F, NR
  - integration with java: NF
  - queue browsing: NF
  - temporary queues: NF
  - xquery: NF

Testing:
  - stress/soak testing for async: NF
  - stress/soak testing for reconnect: NF
  - interop testing: NF
  - multi session and multi connection client tests: NF

Documentation:
  - api level docs largely present but need updating and elaboration
  - tutorial: NF

Examples:
  - drain: F, NR
  - spout: F, NR
  - server: F, NR
  - client: NF
  - other examples, e.g. async?

Miscellaneous:
  - standard ping-like (drain/spout) utilities for all clients: NF
