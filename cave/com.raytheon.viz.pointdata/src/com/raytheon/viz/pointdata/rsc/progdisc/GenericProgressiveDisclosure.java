/**
 * A generic progressive disclosure algorithm that will determine a subset of
 * {@link PlotItem}s that should be displayed given a particular {@link IExtent}
 * and the desired distance between plot items. The exact disclosure for a set
 * of items can be weighted by adding the items in a specific order. In general
 * the items that are added first will displayed sooner than those added later.
 * For example if you were displaying cities, then sorting the cities by
 * population before adding would result in large cities being displayed before
 * small cities.
 * <p>
 * This class was designed to scale well for any number of points. To achieve
 * this it uses a combination of two distinct algorithms with different
 * performance characteristics:
 * <ol>
 * <li>The <b>static algorithm</b>: When a new item is inserted using this
 * algorithm then the position is compared to all the existing items to
 * determine the distance from the closest item. When disclosure is run it is
 * simply a loop over the items to find any with a large enough distance value.
 * This has Θ(n²) insertion time, Θ(n) disclosure time.
 * <li>The <b>dynamic algorithm</b>: When a new item is inserted using this
 * algorithm it is simply appended to the list of items. When disclosure is run
 * then each item is compared to any other displayed items to see if it fits
 * into the display without getting to close. This has Θ(1) insertion time,
 * Θ(n*m) disclosure time(m is the number of items actually displayed).
 * <p>
 * The static algorithm is much better for performance if the disclosure is
 * going to be reused since it has a much faster disclosure time. However the
 * longer insertion time can be a problem for more than 5000-10000 items.
 * <p>
 * Besides raw performance, a major consideration between the two algorithms is
 * that the dynamic algorithm suffers from inconsistent disclosure that can
 * cause a flickering artifact as the extent changes. For example if you zoom in
 * on a display then sometimes there is enough room to replace a single item
 * with two items that are spread further apart, however if those items are too
 * close to other items then they may be removed and replaced with items
 * slightly further away. A very small change to the extent leads to a very big
 * change in the set of items displayed which is generally unpleasant for users.
 * <p>
 * There are two tweaks to the dynamic algorithm that help mitigate the flicker.
 * <ol>
 * <li>First, when the dynamic algorithm is used it caches the disclosed items
 * and tries to disclose the same items across multiple calls, before
 * considering new items. This helps immensely because as the extent changes
 * only minimal changes are made to the set of disclosed items. There can still
 * be a problem if you zoom in on an area and zoom back out, the extra items
 * introduced by zooming in can significantly change the result when zooming
 * out. Although this effect is much more gradual than a flicker, it is still
 * annoying when there is a specific item of interest that disappears
 * unexpectedly.
 * <li>Secondly, pure dynamic disclosure is never used, instead a hybrid of
 * dynamic/static is always used. For the first few thousand items the insertion
 * cost for the static algorithm is very low so using a static algorithm for a
 * certain number of points is beneficial. The static items can be quickly
 * disclosed before adding in the dynamic points and they act like anchor points
 * that help keep the dynamic algorithm more consistent.
 * <p>
 * The hybrid approach provides a balance between getting something to display
 * quickly and keeping the disclosure consistent. If the disclosure is going to
 * be used for awhile it may be worthwhile to use the static disclosure more. It
 * is possible to asynchronously calculate the static values so that as soon as
 * possible the disclosure will be completely consistent(
 * {@link #calculateStaticDistances()}.
 * <p>
 * This class uses internal synchronization to make it safe to use from multiple
 * threads. When properly configured all function calls will be very fast so
 * there should not be significant waiting.
