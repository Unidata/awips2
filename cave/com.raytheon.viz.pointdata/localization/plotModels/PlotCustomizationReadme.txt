A preview of plot model configuration enhancements is available for trial use by sites. The 
enhancements provide additional configuration options in in the SVG file and a GUI available in D2D
to set these new configurations under the Tools -> Plots menu or by right clicking on an open 
product's legend and selecting "Edit Plot Attributes".

In order to enable these features, the baseline .svg files were updated to support these new 
capabilities. However, these enhancement cause can minor display differences from the previous 
baseline files and have not been rigerously tested. These modified files have been made available 
with the "_new" suffix and currently will not be used by default.

To access the new functionality, copy the "_new" versions of the .svg files to the site or user
localization and remove the "_new" from the name. The updated versions should then be picked up the
next time you load a product. 

Note that these new files may slightly change the display of plot models and is considered at this 
time a preview until further testing is done.
