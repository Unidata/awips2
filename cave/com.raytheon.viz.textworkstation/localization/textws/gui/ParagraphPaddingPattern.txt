# This file contains the regex for paragraphs in text product
# that requires special padding.  The padding for impact paragraphs
# is set in WarnGen templates.  Whenever it is changed there, the
# change needs to be reflected in this file as well.  The regex must match the
# entire line and must include parentheses to capture the desired prefix that
# will define the indentation level of the paragraph.
