Vector weather elements, such as Wind, are treated as two numerical arrays,
one representing magnitude and one representing direction. For example:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def calcWind(self, wind_FHAG10):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # The Wind Vector consists
of two numerical array grids, one for magnitude and one for direction
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mag = wind_FHAG10[0]&nbsp;
# get the wind magnitude grid
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir = wind_FHAG10[1]&nbsp;
# get wind direction grid
<p>&nbsp;A Vector Cube consists of two sub-cubes, one for magnitude and
one for direction. For example:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; def calcFreeWind(self,&nbsp; gh_c,&nbsp; wind_c,&nbsp;
topo):
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # The Vector Cube, wind_c,
consists of two sub-cubes, one for magnitude and one for direction
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; magnitudeCube = wind_c[0]
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; directionCube = wind_c[1]
