<h2><a name="StartUpDialog"></a>Start Up Dialog</h2>
The Start Up Dialog appears when the GFE is initializing.
If the system cannot connect to the server, a
message will describe the problem.

<h2><a name="BreakLockDialog"></a>Break Lock Dialog</h2>
<div class="Body">For each grid block selected in the GridManager, the
Break Lock dialog lists the:
<ul>
  <li>Owner of the lock</li>
  <li>Weather Element name</li>
  <li>Lock timerange</li>
  <br>
</ul>
The dialog is separated into two sections, the "Locks Owned By Active
Clients",
and the "Orphaned Locks". Locks that are owned by active clients,
if broken, will likely result in loss of data. If it is a GFE
that
owns those locks, then the forecaster will lose all of his/her unsaved
data.&nbsp; Orphaned Locks, on the other hand, are owned by processes
that
are no longer connected to EDEX. Orphaned locks can
generally
be broken without any consequences.
<p>Select the locks you wish to break and click Breaklock(s) or click
Cancel
at any time to cancel the operation and close the dialog. Note
that
breaking a lock is irreversible. The "Select All Orphans" button
highlights
all of the orphaned entries and the "Clear All" button de-selects the
entries.
For verification purposes, the "Select All Orphans" button does not
highlight
locks owned by active clients; these must be individually selected.

<h2><a name="AutoSaveDialog"></a>Auto Save Interval Dialog</h2>
The Auto Save Interval Dialog allows the user to enable or disable the
automatic save feature of the GFE. If disabled, no weather
elements
will be automatically saved. If enabled, the user may choose an
interval
from one minute to sixty minutes. At this regular interval, the
GFE
checks for modified weather elements. If there are any, then one
weather element at a time is saved with a short interval between
them.
During the auto save process, you will notice that the cursor shape
will
change to the "wait" cursor, and the "green" lock indications on the
Grid
Manager will disappear indicating that those grids have been saved to
the
database.

  <h3>Working With Groups</h3>
While the Weather Element Volume Browser Dialog allows you to load and
unload individual weather elements, occasionally it's convenient to
load
groups of parameters that are related. A Group is a named group of
weather
elements that you can define.
  <ol>
    <li>From the main menu bar, press and hold MB1 over the Weather
Element
menu
item.</li>
    <li>Slide the mouse mouse pointer over the Weather Element Groups
menu item.</li>
    <li>Select one of the pre-defined groups from the Groups cascade
menu.</li>
  </ol>
Note that when you selected the group, a new set of weather elements
was
loaded into the GFE. Also note that the set of weather elements that
was
loaded is now unloaded.
  <p>Saving a group of weather elements is done via the Weather Element
Volume
Browser. To make your own group, follow the steps below. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>From the main menu bar, select WeatherElement-&gt;Weather
Element
Volume Browser.</li>
    <li>Select any group of weather elements.</li>
    <li>From the Weather Element Volume Browser menu bar, select
File-&gt;Save
Weather
Element Group.</li>
    <li>The <a href="#SaveWEGroupDialog">Save Weather Element Group
Dialog</a>
appears. Enter the group name and select Save.</li>
  </ol>
Now your new group has been saved and is ready to be used.<br>
  <p>You can delete saved groups by choosing File--&gt;Delete Weather
Element
Group which brings up the <a href="#DeleteWEGroupDialog">Delete

<hr width="100%">
<h2><a name="ManageHiddenWeatherElements"></a>Manage Hidden Weather
Elements Dialog</h2>
The Manage Hidden Weather Elements Dialog is used to unload and/or make
visible hidden weather elements. Hidden weather elements are
those weather elements which have been created during smart tool
execution or during "Show ISC Mode". The GFE creates
temporary weather elements for purposes of holding calculations.
Some of these may not get unloaded automatically and since these
weather elements are "hidden", i.e., don't appear in the spatial editor
or grid manager, the user is not aware of their existance.<br>
<br>
One example of a hidden weather element is when "Show ISC Mode" is
enabled. The GFE will continue to display just the Fcst
weather elements and not any ISC elements in the grid manager and
spatial editor. The GFE software loads the ISC and any
needed virtual ISC elements in order to display the composite grids in
the editors. When "Show ISC Mode" is turned off, these hidden
elements remain.<br>
<br>
The dialog provides a convenient way to view these "hidden" elements or
to "unload" them.<br>

<h2><a name="SendISCDialog"></a>Send Intersite Grids Dialog</h2>
The Send Intersite Grids dialog controls the sending of grids to
adjacent
sites. Sending of grids is either an automatic process when grids
are saved (if SEND_ISC_ON_SAVE is set in localConfig), or a manual
process accomplished through this dialog. It is not recommended
to use both methods. If SEND_ISC_ON_SAVE in serverConfig/localConfig is
0, or disabled, then this dialog must be used to transmit grids. The
Send Intersite Grids Dialog has two fields in manual mode, and just one
choice for automatic mode. Do not confuse this
automatic mode with the SEND_ISC_ON_SAVE.
<p>In manual mode, the user chooses the set of weather elements to
send, which default to
the currently loaded elements in the Fcst database, the time ranges to
send, whether it be "All Grids", grids over the "Selected Time", or
grids over a specific user-defined time range.</p>
<p>There are several convenient buttons used to select the set of
Weather Elements. By default, the loaded weather elements are selected.
The "Set All" sets all weather elements to on, the "Clear All" sets all
weather elements (and sites) to off, and the Groups button brings up a
menu allowing the forecaster to choose a predefined <a href="#SaveWEGroupDialog">Weather
Element Group</a>. The "Set Selected" option sets the weather
elements and time range to that currently selected in the GFE Grid
Manager.<br>

<p>In automatic mode, EDEX keeps track of what ISC grids have been
sent since the grids were last modified. When Send ISC is chosen with
automatic mode, EDEX sends all grids that were previously modified
but haven't yet been sent via ISC.
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<h2><a name="ISCRequestDialog"></a>Request ISC Dialog</h2>
The Request ISC Dialog is used normally only when starting up service
backup. The purpose of the dialog is to directly request other sites
send
you their entire set of grids for purposes of populating your ISC
database. The normal routing of ISC will slowly fill in your ISC
database,
but frequently the forecaster needs a quicker initialization.
<p>The dialog contains three columns. The first column is the Domain.
The user
selects which domains that he/she wishes to bring into the ISC database
for
this one-time request. As the user selects and deselects domains, the
entries
in the second column, Grid Source, will change. The Grid Source
contains
information about the "known" EDEX servers that are running the desired
domain.
The "best" guess selection for each domain is automatically chosen, but
may
not be the correct choice. For example, if you were down and someone
else
was backing you up, and then you bring up your system and want your own
grids
into the ISC database, the default choice would go to the primary site
for
those grids which is yourself. That won't work -- instead the
forecaster must
choose the site and server that was used to backup your site. </p>
<p>The information in the second column details the Domain, then the
server. The format of the information for the server is the
host/port@site where site is the configured mhs id. Don't
get confused if the domain is your own, but the site is someone else.
This
indicates that there is another server on the network that is running
your
domain. You will frequently see multiple choices whenever a site is
preparing
for service backup, or recovering from service backup. Simply select
one of the choices for each Domain to determine which server to which
to make
the ISC request. </p>
<p>The third column is the Weather Element list. It contains all of the
weather elements you normally receive via ISC. This list defaults to
all elements.
</p>
<p>Pressing the "Make Request" button will send a request to the chosen
EDEX servers, which will process the requests and send you back the
specific
ISC data in the normal fashion.
</p>
<p><img alt="" nosave="" src="images/DialogRequestISC.jpg"><br>
</p>
<p>If you are requesting ISC data from a site with a different office
type than your own (such as an RFC requesting data from a WFO), then
the weather element you request will have the remote office type as
part of its name. For example if you are at a WFO and
want to request QPF. Requesting QPF will work from any WFO,
but you must request QPFrfc to request the data from an
RFC. In a similar fashion, if you are at an RFC and want
QPF from another RFC, simply request QPF. But if you want QPF
from an WFO, you must choose QPFwfo.<br>

gaps,
in which all gaps are interpolated, or based on edited data, in which
only
those grids that been edited will be preserved and all other grids and
gaps will be interpolated.
<p>The user may choose an interpolation interval in hours.
The scale varies from the minimum size of the time constraints for the
selected weather elements up to 24 hours. If the user chooses 1,
then a grid will be created each hour (or the minimum allowable time
for
the weather element). If the user chooses 3, then interpolated
grids
will be created every 3 hours.
</p>
<p>The user may choose the duration of the grids in hours. The
scale
varies from the minimum size of the time constraints for the selected
weather
elements up to 24 hours. If the user chooses 1, then each
interpolated
grid will be 1 hour in length (or the minimum allowable time for the
weather
element). If the user chooses 3, then each interpolated grid will
be 3 hours in length if possible.
</p>
<p>Note that the "Interpolation Interval In Hours" and the "Duration of

time constraint characteristics of the weather elements you have
selected.
The "Duration of Grids in Hours" will not appear when selecting a

The Formatter Launcher Dialog is opened from the Products menu.
The dialog allows you to generate products using the local formatter
infrastructure, define zone combinations, edit the final output
product, and view the output log from the formatter. It is highly
recommended that you Publish To Official prior to generating products
since usually products are generated from the Official Database.<br>
<p>Each product you can generate is listed in the dialog. To learn
how to add your own product selections or change the entries currently
in the dialog, refer to the <a href="TextFormatter.html">Text
Formatter User's Guide</a>. <br>
</p>
<p>By default, product generation will use the Official database for
the data source.
The data source for product generation can be changed to use the Fcst
or the ISC database using the "Data Source" menu. The default
may also be specified in the Definition section of each product
formatter using the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Definition['database']</span>
entry.<br>
</p>
<p>By default, product generation will run on the EDEX platform,
rather than on the local platform. The forecaster may
change this from the "Processor" menu.<br>
</p>
<div class="Body">
<div class="Body">After selecting the product(s) you wish to generate,
go to the appropriate tab and click the "Run" button.<br>
<br>
When the "Run" button is pressed, the product will
be queued for execution. A dialog will usually be displayed
allowing for entry of specific information, such as the issuance
time. After the entry dialog is closed, the actual
formatter will be queued for execution either on the EDEX platform
or local platform. Upon completion, the generated product will be
displayed in the dialog. The user can then edit it, save it to a
file, store it into AWIPS, or transmit it via AWIPS.<br>

<h2><a name="ProcessMonitorDialog"></a>Process Monitor Dialog</h2>
The Process Monitor Dialog displays the queue of pending and finished

run from the Product Generation Scripts and Formatter Launcher Dialogs,
the GFE will queue them for execution.&nbsp; This dialog can be used to
display and manipulate the queue. <br>
<br>
<img style="width: 642px; height: 342px;" alt="ProcessMonitorDialog"
 src="images/DialogProcessMonitor1.jpg"><br>
<br>
The "Local Scripts" section shows the pending, running, and finished
processes that were queued locally. Only the processes that were
started by the current GFE will be shown. The "Server
Scripts" section shows the pending, running, and finished processes
that were queued remotely. Processes queued by you, as well as
other GFEs, will be shown in this area of the dialog.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 24px; height: 27px;" alt="start button" title=""

when
the process is running. If the process is still pending,

process to begin, even if it will exceed the maximum configured number
of background processes.<br>

<img alt="kill button" title="" src="images/DialogProcessMonitor3.jpg">
The "kill" button is used to abort or kill a running process, or delete
the process from the pending queue if it isn't running yet.<br>

<img style="width: 23px; height: 27px;" alt="terminal button" title=""
 src="images/DialogProcessMonitor4.jpg"> The
"terminal" button, when pressed, will open up a window that contains
the standard output and standard error information from the process.
The terminal only holds a configurable number of lines so processes
that produce a lot of output may not have all of their output contained
in the dialog. The window may be opened up at any time, while it is
pending, running, or finished. Some log messages may not be written to
the terminal window unless the .logPref file is correctly
configured. The terminal button is only available for
server processes after the process has finished.<br>
