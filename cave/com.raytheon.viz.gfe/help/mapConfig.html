<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
The Maps.py file defines how edit areas are generated for each map. 
When activated, the server processes the list of maps defined in the Maps.py file
and generates edit areas. 
<p>The edit area generation software uses the maps database tables as input. 
These tables are populated by importing shape files provided by the National Weather Service. 
These tables are filtered by domain (based on the site) and attributes.
There are different attributes available for each table.
Refer to the AWIPS Map Background Database provided by the National Weather Service 
for details on the available shapefiles and the attributes contained within each
shapefile.
This information will be needed in order to tailor edit area generation for your site.
</p>
<p>The user can select which polygons will be converted into edit areas and 
to which edit area groups they will be assigned.
</p>

Software releases after Jan 1, 2006 separate the map shapefile from the
CORE GFE.&nbsp;&nbsp; In some applications, such as AWIPS, the map
shapefile configuration becomes the responsibility of the site since
the map shapefiles will no longer be shipped with the GFE
software. A separate install is available for non-AWIPS
purposes and is posted with the software releases. If the
associated Map Shapefile is not installed at your site, then
sites will be responsible for:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Downloading updated shapefiles from the NOAA1 web server</li>
  <li>Importing the downloaded shapefiles into the maps database</li>
  <li>Creating/modifying the localMaps.py file to reference the appropriate database tables</li>

<h3><a name="MapDefinitions"></a><b>Map Definitions</b></h3>
The map definition section defines each map for which edit area generation is desired.
Only a small portion of the Maps.py is shown here. Numerous examples with differing
capabilities are shown.
<h4>Basic Map with Automatically Generated Edit Areas</h4>
This definition is for a basic map, with no filtering of attributes and automatic creation 
of edit areas. The edit areas will be included in the 'Misc' edit area group by default since
no edit area group is specified.
The ShapeTable object is created in the first line. The name of the maps database table 
is passed as a parameter to the ShapeTable constructor.  
  
<pre>
CWAzones = ShapeTable('zone')
CWAzones.name = CWA + '_zones'
CWAzones.editAreaName = ['state','zone']
</pre>
The ifpServer can automatically generate edit areas based on the
information in the shapefiles. The user specifies the "editAreaName" in
the Maps.py or localMaps.py files, and the ifpServer uses that
information to determine the name of each edit area.&nbsp;&nbsp; There
are three forms to the editAreaName line as shown:<br>
<br>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">mapVariable.editAreaName =
"string"<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Single String Format<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">mapVariable.editAreaName =
["string1", "string2", "string3"]<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">List of Strings Format<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">mapVariable.editAreaName =
functionName<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Function Format<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<h5>Single String Format</h5>
In the example below, the name of each generated edit area is obtained
from the attribute <b>zone</b> specified in the field editAreaName. The program looks
up the value for the attribute <b>zone</b> in the database record for each polygon
and creates an edit area with that name. The example below uses the simple
format for the editAreaName, in which only one attribute is specified.
<pre>
CWAzones = ShapeTable('zone')
CWAzones.name = CWA + '_zones'
CWAzones.editAreaName = 'zone'
</pre>
<p>Examples of the names of the edit areas generated from the above
snippet
is shown in the following table:
<br>
&nbsp;
<table nosave="" border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>zone value from shapefile</td>
      <td>state (not used in this example)</td>
      <td>Name of Edit Area</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>034</td>
      <td>CO</td>
      <td>zone034</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>041</td>
      <td>CO</td>
      <td>zone041</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>041</td>
      <td>NE</td>
      <td>zone041</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>Note that if a site's domain covers more than one state, this simple form of generating
edit area names will not work. The "NE" example above illustrates
that the same edit area name was generated even though the zones were
from different states. Also note that the naming of the edit area includes
the name "zone" only because the value of the zone value begins with a
number.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">NOTE:
Changing the default set of edit area names as supplied in the baseline
may render your text formatters and VTEC inoperable. The text
formatters and VTEC assume standard UGC-named edit areas, such as
COZ023 and UTC013.</span><br>
</p>
<h5>List of Strings Format</h5>
<p>A second, more complex form of the editAreaName involves using
a Python list. The naming of an edit area is determined by
using more than one attribute. This example uses the more complex
form for the editAreaName, in which two attributes are specified.
</p>
<pre>
CWAzones = ShapeTable('zone')
CWAzones.name = CWA + '_zones'
CWAzones.editAreaName = ['state','zone']
</pre>
<p>Examples of the names of the edit areas generated from the above
snippet
is shown in the following table:
<br>
&nbsp;
<table nosave="" border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>zone value from shapefile</td>
      <td>state (not used in this example)</td>
      <td>Name of Edit Area</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>034</td>
      <td>CO</td>
      <td>CO_034</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>041</td>
      <td>CO</td>
      <td>CO_041</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>041</td>
      <td>NE</td>
      <td>NE_041</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>The edit area name is determined from the value of the <b>state</b>
attribute,
followed by an underscore character, and then the value of the <b>zone</b>
attribute.
</p>
<p>Here is the software algorithm for naming of edit areas:
</p>
<ul>
<li>the value for each of the attributes is extracted from the
shapefiles.
All spaces and non-alphanumeric characters are removed from the
value.<br>
Example: "Washington Meadows" would be changed to "WashingtonMeadows"
</li>
<li>if any of the values results in an empty string, then the edit area is not generated.
</li>
<li>the values are put together with an underscore separator for each of the attributes.<br>
Example: Attribute <b>state</b> has a value of "CO", Attribute <b>zone</b> has a value of "034". 
Result is CO_034.
</li>
<li>if the leading character of the result begins with a number, then the name
of the first attribute is prefixed to the string.<br>
Example: If the preceding string was 034 and its attribute was <b>zone</b>, then the resulting
edit area name becomes zone034.
</li>
</ul>
The ordering of the list of attributes can change the naming as shown
in
the following table, which assumes <b>zone</b>=034, <b>state</b>=CO, <b>wfo</b>=BOU,
<b>name</b>=Summit County/Mosquito Range/Indian Peaks:
<br>
&nbsp;
<table nosave="" border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>editAreaName string</td>
      <td>Name of Edit Area</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>'zone'</td>
      <td>zone034</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>['zone','state']</td>
      <td>zone034_CO</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>['state','zone']</td>
      <td>CO_034</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>['wfo','name']</td>
      <td>BOU_SummitCountyMosquitoRangeIndianPeaks</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>['zone','name','state']</td>
      <td>zone034_SummitCountyMosquitoRangeIndianPeaks_CO</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Note that specification of an attribute that doesn't exist will simply
use the name in the string. For example, if you are creating edit
areas and you want them of the form ISC_xxx, where xxx is the value of the <b>wfo</b>
attribute.
The editAreaName string would be the following:
<pre>
ISCareas.editAreaName = ['ISC', 'wfo'] 
</pre>
</p>
<p>
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">
NOTE: Changing the default set of edit area names as supplied in the baseline may
render your text formatters and VTEC inoperable. The text formatters
and VTEC assume standard UGC-named edit areas, such as COZ023 and UTC013.
</span>
</p>
<h5>Function Format<br>
</h5>
<p>
Occasionally there is a need to calculate a special edit area name and
the single or list of strings methods are not sufficient. The
function format requires the user to name a function and then define a
function. The function has one argument, which receives a
dictionary of attribute names and their values. The return
value of the function is a string which becomes the edit area name.
</p>
<p>
For example, lets say that we want edit area names based on the county
FIPS code. The desired format is stateCfips, such as COC013, for
Colorado County #13. The county shapefile has a 'STATE'
attribute, such as "CO", and it has a 'FIPS' attribute, such as 08013
for Colorado County #13.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the list of strings format,
['STATE', 'C', 'FIPS'], you would end up with CO_C_08013, when we
really want COC013. 
</p>
This is how the code would be implemented:
<pre>
def cwaEAN(atts):
    fips = atts['fips'][-3:]        #take the last three characters from the FIPS code
    s = atts['state'] + "C" + fips  #assemble the name
    return s                        #return the complete edit area name
    
CWAcounties = ShapeTable('county')
CWAcounties.name = CWA + '_counties'
CWAcounties.editAreaName = cwaEAN
</pre>
The "atts" dictionary looks simlilar to the following:
<pre>
{'countyname': 'Delta', 
 'cwa': 'MQT'
 'fe_area': 'sr', 
 'fips': '26041', 
 'lat': 45.82085, 
 'lon': -86.909679999999994, 
 'state': 'MI', 
 'time_zone': 'E',
}
</pre>
and the final string is: MIC041<br>
<h4>Basic Map with Automatically Generated Edit Areas with group
definition</h4>
An example of a basic map with automatically generated edit areas with
group definition:
This is identical to the Basic Map with Automatically Generated Edit
Areas case except that the user has specified a group name. All of
the generated edit areas will be placed in the edit area group called
'Zones'.
<pre>
CWAzones = ShapeTable('zone')
CWAzones.name = CWA + '_zones'
CWAzones.editAreaName = 'zone'
CWAzones.groupName = 'Zones'
</pre>
<h4>Filtered Map with Automatically Generated Edit Areas</h4>
This definition is for a filtered map with no automatic creation of edit
areas. The filter line performs the filtering. The basic format
of this line is as follows:
<pre>
pythonMapName.filter(lambda x : x['ATTRIBUTENAME'] = AttributeValue)
</pre>
<p>where ATTRIBUTENAME is one of the <a href="#Attributes">attributes</a>
in the shapefile, and AttributeValue is the value that must match in
the
shapefile for this shape to be kept in the map. Attributes for the NWS
shapefiles can be obtained from the AWIPS Map Catalog <a
 href="http://www.nws.noaa.gov/geodata/">AWIPS
Map Background Database</a>.
</p>
<pre>
CWAzones = ShapeTable('Zone')
CWAzones.name = CWA + '_zones'
CWAzones.filter(lambda x : x['cwa'] == CWA)
CWAzones.editAreaName = cwazones
</pre>
<p>The "lambda" function is a shortcut method of writing a function,
the code snippet below performs the identical function:
</p>
<pre>
def cwaZoneFilt(x):
    return x['cwa'] == CWA

CWAzones = ShapeTable('zone')
CWAzones.name = CWA + '_zones'
CWAzones.filter(cwaZoneFilt)
CWAzones.editAreaName = cwazones
</pre>
<p>Since this is all Python code, there is another technique you can
use to write a filter function which is complex. Here is an example
of writing a filter that selects certain counties (Summit, Sandusky,
Huron, and Medina) from the county database table for a particular state (Ohio) and
cwa (Cleveland):
</p>
<pre>
def exampleFilt(x):
    myCounties = ['Summit', 'Sandusky', 'Huron', 'Medina']
    return x['countyname'] in myCounties and x['st'] == "OH" and x['cwa'] = 'CLE'

OHcounties = ShapeTable('county')
OHcounties.name = 'ExampleOHCounties'
OHcounties.filter(exampleFilt)
OHcounties.editAreaName = 'countyname'
</pre>
<h4>Filtered Map with Automatically Generated Edit Areas with group
definition</h4>
This is identical to the Filtered Map with Automatically Generated Edit
Areas case except that the user has specified a group name. All
of the generated edit areas will be placed in the edit area group called 'Zones'.
<pre>
CWAzones = ShapeTable('zone')
CWAzones.name = CWA + '_zones'
CWAzones.filter(lambda x : x['cwa'] == CWA)
CWAzones.editAreaName = ['state','zone']
CWAzones.groupName = 'Zones'
</pre>
<h2><a name="PuttingitallTogetherwiththemaplist"></a>Putting it all
Together with the map list</h2>
In order for the system to recognize the list of defined maps, they
must be put all together in a list. The list MUST be called
maps. This example list, shows that there are three maps defined. The
entries within the list are the Python variable names (name to the left of the
equal sign on the ShapeTable line).
<pre>
maps = [ CWAcounties, Counties, CWAzones ]
</pre>
<h2><a name="ImportinglocalMaps"></a>Importing localMaps</h2>
The final section of the Maps.py file is the software that checks for a
localMaps configuration and uses it if it exists. Do not change
this
section of the file.
<pre>
# import the local maps file</tt>
try:
    import localMaps
