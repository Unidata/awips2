after sky and before the max/min temp? Change the order of
the phrase methods in the "phraseList" of the Product Component.</li>

customize my product? Find the phrase in the Product Component
"phraseList" and look it up in the <a href="TextReferenceInfrastructureReference.html#NARRATIVEPHRASES">Narrative
