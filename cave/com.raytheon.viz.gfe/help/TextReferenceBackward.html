<span style="font-weight: bold;">Transitioning from IFPS15 to IFPS16:<br>
</span>There are major structural changes in the formatters from IFPS15
to IFPS16.&nbsp; Information on transitioning your formatters can be
found in the Power Point presentation at:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a

</span><b><font color="#000000">Transitioning from IFPS13/RPP20 to
IFPS14/RPP21:</font></b> <br>
Products that ran in IFPS13&nbsp; will NOT run in the current
infrastructure.&nbsp; You must delete (or rename) all your existing
Local files and customize the core products delivered with the
release.&nbsp;&nbsp; It may be helpful to simply re-name your Local
files so you can refer to them when customizing the new core products.
Be aware that most of the methods have changed, so the actual
customization code cannot be copied from the old Local file to the
new.&nbsp; However, you will have a record of the kinds of
customizations you may need to make to the new products.&nbsp; Make
sure
that you delete infrastructure overrides such as the "Holidays" file
which changed in this version.
<p><b><font color="#000000">Products from IFPS14/RPP21 and beyond:</font></b>
<br>
Products that run in IFPS14/RPP21&nbsp; and beyond should be
compatible&nbsp; with the current release.&nbsp; The few exceptions are
highlighted in the Release Notes. </p>
<p><b>Products Created in RPP17 or Prior:</b> <br>
If your site is running existing products using the infrastructure from
RPP17 or before,&nbsp; they will continue to work for a few more
releases.&nbsp; However, after reading the Advanced Text Product
Documentation (to be supplied), you should convert these products to
the
new infrastructure as the old infrastructure will eventually be
discontinued. </p>
