<ul>
<li CLASS="4Heading">
<b>Purpose:</b> Modify a scalar grid values using the temporal editor</li>
</ul>

<div CLASS="Body">Before you begin: Set up your GFE so that the spatial
and temporal editors are visible. Load T (temperature) via the Weather
Element->Weather Element Browser... dialog.</div>

<div CLASS="Step-First">
<ol>
<li>
Make or find a temperature grid and display it as an image in the spatial
editor.</li>

<li>
Clear the edit area by clicking MB1 on the Clear button.</li>

<li>
Use the Select Points tool to define an edit area the size of a few counties.</li>

<li>
Find the T (temperature) weather element in the temporal editor. Vertically
stretch the size of the temporal editor pane so that there's plenty of
room to see the time series display.</li>

<li>
In the temporal scale, located to the left of the time series display,
click MB2 to zoom in until the minimum and maximum values are about 20
degrees F apart.</li>

<li>
Find the data point in the time series that represents the grid displayed
in the spatial editor. This point is identified by the dotted yellow line.</li>

<li>
Click MB1 about 10 degrees F above the data point. Note the change in the
spatial editor display. All the points you identified in the spatial editor
have been assigned the value you selected in the temporal editor.&nbsp;
This is called the "absolute" mode for temporal editing.</li>

<li>
Initialize about 12 hours worth of temperature data from you favorite model.
Use the interpolation facility (Grids->Interpolate) to fill in the gaps
and get a smooth time-series curve.</li>

<li>
Back in the temporal editor pane, move the cursor to somewhere near left
side of the time-series display. Move the cursor over one of the horizontal
lines that display the temporal values and press and hold MB1 and slowly
drag horizontally to define a new temperature curve. As you move the cursor
to the next data point, it should snap to your cursor position. Each time
this happens, you are modifying data in a different grid. Note that you
MUST start the edit operation over one of the displayed values. Starting
the operation in a gap will not modify any data.</li>

<li>
Release MB1.</li>

<li>
Step through your newly-modified grids using the Grid Manager or the Step
Forward / Step Backwards buttons
to see that you modified a series of grids with one edit operation.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div CLASS="Body">Repeat this exercise until you are comfortable using
the Adjust Scalar temporal tool. This and all the temporal tools are capable
of modifying a large quantity of data with only a few edit operations.
Used properly, these tools can save you lots of time.</div>

<h3 CLASS="2Heading">
<a NAME="EditingVectorDataTemporally"></a>Editing Vector Data Temporally</h3>

<ul>
<li CLASS="4Heading">
<b>Purpose:</b> Modify a vector grid values using the temporal editor</li>
</ul>

<div CLASS="Body">Before you begin: Set up your GFE so that the spatial
and temporal editors are visible. Load Wind via the Weather Element->Weather
Element Browser... dialog. Make sure that the GFE->Editing Preferences->Temporal
Edit Mode: Relative is deselected..</div>

<div CLASS="Step-First">
<ol>
<li>
Make or find a Wind grid and display it as an image in the spatial editor.</li>

<li>
Set the Vector edit mode located main menu bar GFE->Editing Preferences->Vector
Edit Mode->Both to edit both magnitude and direction.</li>

<li>
Use the Select Points tool to define an edit area the size of a few counties.</li>

<li>
Find the Wind weather element in the temporal editor. Vertically stretch
the size of the temporal editor pane so that there's plenty of room to
see the time series display.</li>

<li>
In the temporal scale, located to the left of the time series display,
click MB2 to zoom in until the minimum and maximum values are about 20
knots F apart. Clicking MB1 zooms out. Dragging MB1 pans the scale.</li>

<li>
Find the data point in the time series that represents the grid displayed
in the spatial editor. This point is identified by the dotted yellow line.</li>

<li>
Click MB1 about 10 knots above the data point. Note the change in the spatial
editor display. All the points you identified in the spatial editor have
been assigned the value you selected in the temporal editor.</li>

<li>
Release MB1.</li>

<li>
Press and hold MB1 and move the cursor up or down to adjust the vector
data point again. Note how the wind barb updates as you adjust the magnitude.</li>

<li>
Release MB1.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<div CLASS="Body">If you're editing wind magnitude only, the vector adjust
tool works just like the scalar adjust tool. It's when you edit the direction
that things get interesting.</div>

<ol>
<li CLASS="Step">
Press and hold down the Shift key on your keyboard.</li>

<li CLASS="Step">
Move the cursor over any wind data point, press and hold MB1 and adjust.
Note that the wind direction is changing while the magnitude remains constant.
The wind direction shifts from North clockwise and back to North as you
move from the lower extreme of the temporal pane to the upper extreme of
the temporal pane.</li>

<li CLASS="Step">
Release MB1.</li>
</ol>

<div CLASS="Body">This exercise demonstrates that with the Shift button
up, the temporal adjust vector tool changes the magnitude. With the Shift
button down, the tool changes the wind direction.</div>

<ul>
<li CLASS="4Heading">
<b>Purpose:</b> Modify a weather grid values using the temporal editor</li>
</ul>

<div CLASS="Body">Before you begin: Set up your GFE so that the spatial
and temporal editors are visible. Load Wx via the Weather Element->Weather
Element Browser... dialog. Make sure that the TE Edit Mode: Relative button
is still de-selected.</div>

<div CLASS="Step-First">
<ol>
<li>
Make or find a Wx grid and display it as an image in the spatial editor.</li>

<li>
Use the Select Points tool to define an edit area the size of a few counties.</li>

<li>
Find the Wx weather element in the temporal editor. Vertically stretch
the size of the temporal editor pane so that there's plenty of room to
see the time series display.</li>

<li>
In the Spatial Editor legend, select a pickup value by clicking MB2. You
may need to invoke the <a href="ButtonBarDialogs.html#PickUpValueDialog">set
value dialog</a> to add additional weather types.</li>

<li>
Find the data point in the time series that represents the grid displayed
in the spatial editor. This point is identified by the dotted yellow line.</li>

<li>
Click MB1 on this data point in the Wx pane of the temporal editor. You
should see the temporal editor paint the same color/pattern as you selected
in the spatial editor legend. The spatial editor will show you that the
area that you selected in Step 2 has been set to this new value. Even if
there were multiple weather types displayed previously, when the MB1 action
is executed, all grid points in the edit area will be set to the new value.</li>
</ol>
There are several other ways to change the data in the temporal editor
for Wx. A MB3 popup menu over a data point in the time series will
bring up a menu containing several items. The items that will edit
the data are Set..., Set to Recent Value..., and Set to Common Value....
The Set... brings up the <a href="TemporalEditorDialogs.html#SetWeatherDialog">Set
Weather Dialog</a>. The Set to Recent Value brings up a cascade menu
of recently set pickup values for weather, and the Set to Common Value...
brings up a cascade menu of commonly set pickup values. Unlike the
<a href="Button3Popups.html#SpatialEditorColorBarPopupMenu">color
bar on the spatial editor</a>, these menu entries set not only the pickup
value, but also modify the data.
<p>The set of common weather values are site-configurable through the gfe
configuration file's <a href="gfeConfig.html#WeatherCommonValueDefinitions">common
weather values entry</a>.
<br></div>

<div CLASS="Body">The temporal Set Value tool does not support drag operations
as with the scalar and vector tools. Only MB1 clicks, or selection of a
common value, recent value, or using the Set... will modify data in the
Wx pane.
<p>MB2 click on a weather value in the temporal editor display can also
be used to set the pick-up value.

<div CLASS="Body">Before you begin: Set up your GFE so that the spatial
and temporal editors are visible. Load Wx via the Weather Element->Weather
Element Browser... dialog. Make sure that the TE Edit Mode: Relative button
is still de-selected.</div>

<div CLASS="Step-First">
<ol>
<li>
Make or find a DISCRETE grid, such as Headlines, and display it as
an image in the spatial editor.</li>

<li>

you have chosen.</li>

<li>
Find the data point in the time series that represents the grid displayed
in the spatial editor. This point is identified by the dotted yellow line.</li>

<li>
Click MB1 on this data point in the Discrete pane of the temporal editor.
You should see the temporal editor paint the same color/pattern as you
selected in the spatial editor legend. The spatial editor will show you
that the area that you selected in Step 2 has been set to this new value.</li>

There are several other ways to change the data in the temporal editor
for discrete weather elements. A MB3 popup menu over a data point
in the time series will bring up a menu containing several items.
The items that will edit the data are Set..., Set to Recent Value..., and
Set to Common Value.... The Set... brings up the <a href="TemporalEditorDialogs.html#SetDiscreteDialog">Set
