<p>The Time Scale is located immediately above the Grid Manager (or
Temporal
Editor) and shows you the time period over which the every grid is
valid.
In addtion, it contains a small green triangle that indicates the
current
time. The yellow dotted line displays the current Spatial Editor
Time and the blue hatching shows the Selected Time Period.
User-defined time periods are shown at the very top of the time scale.
