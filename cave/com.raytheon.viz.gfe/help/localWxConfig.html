<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
<div class="Body">The localWxConfig.py file is one of several
configuration
files for GFE. The localWxConfig
file is optional, and is not provided with the install or
release.
It is added by the field site to override certain features of the GFE
database configuration that are defined in the <a
 href="serverConfig.html">serverConfig.py</a>
file. <b><font color="#ff0000">You should NEVER change the
original
serverConfig.py since your changes will be overwritten with the next
upgrade.
See the <a
 href="serverConfiguration.html#ServerDatabaseConfigurationModificationOptions">server
configuration overview</a> for information on how to make changes that
are supported to the server.</font></b>
<p>The localWxConfig.py file can be used to override the weather
definitions
in <a href="serverConfig.html">serverConfig.py</a>. This document
will describe what you can, and what you cannot override. If you
need to override an element that is not supported by <a
 href="localConfig.html">localConfig.py</a>
or localWxConfig.py, then refer to the <font color="#000000"><a
 href="serverConfiguration.html#ServerDatabaseConfigurationModificationOptions">server
configuration overview</a> for details.</font><font color="#000000"></font>
</p>
<p><b><font color="#ff0000"><b>Note:</b> Changing weather definitions can
cause problems when sending these grids to other sites via Intersite
Coordination.
If another site receives grids that do not contain valid Weather
Definitions
at that site, the grid will be rejected.</font></b>

<h2><a name="AddingYourOwnlocalConfig.pyFile"></a>Adding Your Own
localWxConfig.py
File</h2>
If you want to make changes to the server database weather definitions,
then you will want to add your own localWxConfig.py file. Refer
to the <a href="serverConfiguration.html#LocationofFiles">server
configuration
overview file location section</a> for details on where the
localWxConfig.py
file should be located.
<p>The first lines of the localWxConfig.py <i>must</i> have the
following
format. Failure to do so will not let you refer to any of the
definitions
in serverConfig.py:
</p>
<p><tt>from serverConfig import *</tt>
<br>
<tt>import serverConfig</tt>
</p>
<p>The syntax appearing in localWxConfig.py varies depending whether
you
are adding new definitions, or changing existing definitions.
Typically
when changing existing definitions you will need to prefix the
serverConfig
to the name of the variable. For example,
</p>
<p><tt>var = (a,b,c,d)</tt> refers to a local copy of this definition
and
doesn't override the definition in serverConfig.py
</p>
<p><tt>serverConfig.var = (a,b,c,d) </tt>refers to the variable in the
serverConfig and overrides it.
</p>
<p>The localWxConfig.py file is created through your favorite text
editor.
</p>
<p><a href="EXAMPLElocalWxConfig.py">Example localWxConfig.py file</a>
</p>
<p><i>Note that the format of localWxConfig is difficult, due to the
fact
that the weather definition in serverConfig.py is a composite of many
different
objects.&nbsp; This makes it more difficult to override or redefine
fields.</i>
<br>
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<h2><a name="Testing"></a>Testing Your Own localWxConfig.py File</h2>
The recommended way to test your localWxConfig.py file is to start EDEX
while running a tail command on the /awips2/edex/logs/edex-request-<i>date</i>.log.
If no exceptions result from the changes, you should be fine to proceed into GFE for
further testing.

<h2><a name="WhatcanyoucontrolfromyourcustomlocalConfig"></a>What
can
you control from your custom localWxConfig.py file?</h2>
The following table describes what can be done using a custom
localWxConfig.py
file. If the override capability is marked as "NO" and you still
need the modification, you will need to review <a
 href="serverConfiguration.html#ServerDatabaseConfigurationModificationOptions">methods
of modifying database configurations</a> for alternative choices.

<h3><a name="ChangingVisibility"></a>Changing Visibilities</h3>
Visibilities are very easy to change.&nbsp; Basically you redefine the
set of visibilities and prefix the entry with serverConfig.&nbsp; For
example,
the following line changes the set of possible visibilities to values
without
the default "SM":
<p><tt>serverConfig.visibilities = ['&lt;NoVis&gt;', '0', '1/4', '1/2',
'3/4',
'1', '11/2',</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
'2', '21/2', '3', '4', '5', '6', 'P6']</tt>
</p>
<p></p>
<hr width="100%">
<h3><a name="ChangingCoverages"></a>Changing Coverages and Probabilities</h3>
If you are adding a new coverage or probability, the syntax is straight
forward.&nbsp; In order to use the new coverage or probability, you
will
need to also provide a new weather type definition.&nbsp; Here is an
example
of adding a new coverage called "Sparse":
<p><tt>SPARSE = ('Sparse', 'Sparse')</tt>
</p>
<p>Note there is not a serverConfig. in front of the command.&nbsp;
That
is because you are not overridding an existing definition.
</p>
<p>If you want to change an existing definition, the syntax is
basically
the same as above.&nbsp; You will not need to put serverConfig. in
front
of it, but you will need to redefine all of the weather types
completely.&nbsp;
Here is an example of modifying isolated coverage to use a different
symbol:
</p>
<p><tt>ISOD = ('Isod', 'Isolated')</tt>
</p>
<p>This statement by itself will not do anything.&nbsp; You will need
to
use the new definition later on in the file.
</p>
<p>In serverConfig.py, there are convenient groupings, such as COV,
that
group several coverages and probabilities together.&nbsp; If you want
to
change the definition of those, or you want to change the definition of
a coverage or probability inside of those, then you have to completely
redefine the individual coverage (as shown above) and redefine the
grouping.&nbsp;
In this case, we want to redefine the COV to contain SPARSE and our new
definition of ISOD.
</p>
<p><tt>COV = [ISOD, SCT, NUM, WIDE, SPARSE]</tt>
</p>
<p>Note that ISOD is referring to the localWxConfig's definition of
ISOD,
and not the server config's definition.&nbsp; Also note that COV is a
modified
local copy of the server's COV definition.&nbsp; To use these
definitions,
you will have to refer to them later in the file.
<br>
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<h2><a name="ChangingIntensity"></a>Changing Intensities</h2>
If you are adding a new intensity, the syntax is straight
forward.&nbsp;
In order to use the new intensity, you will need to also provide a new
weather type definition.&nbsp; Here is an example of adding a new
intensity
called "Super Heavy":
<p><tt>SUPERHEAVY = ('+++', "Super Heavy")</tt>
</p>
<p>Note there is not a serverConfig. in front of the command.&nbsp;
That
is because you are not overridding an existing definition.
</p>
<p>If you want to change an existing definition, the syntax is
basically
the same as above.&nbsp; You will not need to put serverConfig. in
front
of it, but you will need to redefine all of the weather types
completely.&nbsp;
Here is an example of modifying isolated coverage to use a different
symbol:
</p>
<p><tt>INTEN_MOD = ('mod', 'Moderate')</tt>
</p>
<p>This statement by itself will not do anything.&nbsp; You will need
to
use the new definition later on in the file.
</p>
<p>In serverConfig.py, there are convenient groupings, such as
PCPINTEN,
that group several intensities together.&nbsp; If you want to change
the
definition of those, or you want to change the definition of a
intensity
inside of those, then you have to completely redefine the individual
intensity
(as shown above) and redefine the grouping.&nbsp; In this case, we want
to redefine the PCPINTEN to contain SUPERHEAVY and our new definition
of
INTEN_MOD.
</p>
<p><tt>PCPINTEN = [INTEN_VERYLIGHT, INTEN_LIGHT, INTEN_MOD,
INTEN_HEAVY,
SUPERHEAVY]</tt>
</p>
<p>Note that INTEN_MOD is referring to the localWxConfig's definition
of
INTEN_MOD, and not the server config's definition, since serverConfig.
was not placed in front of it.&nbsp; Also note that PCPINTEN is a
modified
local copy of the server's PCPINTEN definition.&nbsp; To use these
definitions,
you will have to refer to them later in the file.
<br>
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<h3><a name="ChaingAttributes"></a>Changing Optional Attributes</h3>
If you are adding a new optional attribute, the syntax is straight
forward.&nbsp;
In order to use the new attribute, you will need to also provide a new
weather type definition.&nbsp; Here is an example of adding a new
intensity
called "Lousy":
<p><tt>LOUSY = ('Lsy', 'Lousy')</tt>
</p>
<p>Note there is not a serverConfig. in front of the command.&nbsp;
That
is because you are not overridding an existing definition.
</p>
<p>If you want to change an existing definition, the syntax is
basically
the same as above.&nbsp; You will not need to put serverConfig. in
front
of it, but you will need to redefine all of the weather types
completely.&nbsp;
Here is an example of modifying Frequent Lightning to use a different
symbol:
</p>
<p><tt>FQTLTG = ('FqLt', 'Frequent Lightning')</tt>
</p>
<p>This statement by itself will not do anything.&nbsp; You will need
to
use the new definition later on in the file.
</p>
<p></p>
<hr width="100%">
<h3><a name="ChangingDefinition"></a>Changing Weather Type Definition</h3>
This is the section where all of the type definitions come
together.&nbsp;
Based on what you enter in this section, you can remove, change, or add
new weather type definitions.&nbsp; You will have to completely define
all of the weather types you need for the GFE in this section.&nbsp; Do
not try to simply append or remove entries from the existing list.
<p>The format of the entries are:
<br>
<tt>TypeSymbol = ('Symbol', 'Description', [coverages], [intensities],
[optional attributes])</tt>
</p>
<p>Remember to refer to symbols without serverConfig. in front of it to
refer to the modified or added values in your localWxConfig file.&nbsp;
You can also refer to unchanged symbols from serverConfig in the same
manner.&nbsp;
Normally you should not need to place serverConfig. in front of any
entry.&nbsp;
The rule is if you are redefining a coverage/probability, intensity,
optional
attribute, or grouping of these, then you will use that symbol name in
the weather type definition.
</p>
<p>The next step is to define each weather type.&nbsp; For example, we
want to keep the &lt;NoWx&gt; definition. Since we have not made any
modifications
to the possible coverages, intensities, attributes from what was in
serverConfig.py,
we can simply refer to it with NOWX.&nbsp; We also want to allow just
RAIN
and SNOW.&nbsp; These will need to be redefined to use our FQTLTG,
LOUSY,
PCPINTEN, and modified COV values.&nbsp; Here are the entries:
</p>
<p><tt>RAIN = ('R', 'Rain', COV, PCPINTEN, [FQTLTG])</tt>
<br>
<tt>SNOW = ('S', 'Snow', [WIDE, SPARSE], [INTEN_LIGHT, INTEN_HEAVY],
[LOUSY, OVRPASS])</tt>
</p>
<p>Then tie it all together with the types command. <font
 color="#ff0000">Note
that the "types =" must be exactly that in order for serverConfig.py to
pick up your definitions</font>:
</p>
<p><tt>types = [NOWX, RAIN, SNOW]</tt>
</p>
<p>The result of the statements identified in this file is shown in the
following table:
