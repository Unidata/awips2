An example will help us see how this works. Suppose we have rain and fog in the morning then rain, fog and snow in the afternoon.  The "preProcessWx" method arranges the sub-phrases according to time span. Next, the "separateNonPrecip" method splits the original phrase into two weather phrases, the original with Rain and Snow disabled, a new one with Fog disabled.   Note that the original retains its sub-phrase structure; the disabledSubkeys ensure that the wording reflects Fog only.  The new weather_phrase now undergoes the "preProcessWx" method which results in sub-phrases that produce the final words.
