For each weather element involved in the phrase, we create an ElementInfo entry.  This includes the elementName e.g. "Wind", a mergeMethod such as "List", "MinMax", or "Average".  For the first element in the ElementInfoList, the mergeMethod should be "List".  This is the mechanism by which phrases will be analysis-driven.  Other elements involved in the phrase cannot use the "List" mergeMethod and must use "Min", "Max", "MinMax", or "Average". This means that they follow the temporal resolution of the first element.  The default dataType is Scalar.  We must specify if the element is Vector or Weather.  We can do this using the special "self.VECTOR()" and "self.WEATHER()" values.  If we want to use a statistics other than the first one listed in the analysisList, we can specify a statLabel.  We can specify if the element is primary or secondary with respect to consolidaition rules.  Finally, for primary elements other than the first, we need to specify a phrase definition method to be used when splitting off independent phrases.
