You can access information in the Statistics Dictionary using the "tree.stats.get" method which takes a weather element, time range, and area label.  You can optionally specify a statistics method which will return the analysis for that particular SampleAnalysis method.  Sometimes we will request data for a time range which covers multiple time periods.  In this case, we can specify a "mergeMethod" to be used in merging the statistics returned. The default method is "List".  You may specify "Max", "Min", "MinMax", "Average", or "List".  If you specify "List", a set of (statistics, timeRange) tuples will be returned.
