It is possible to set up a phrase to report ONLY the most important sub-phrase. This is done by adding entries to the "mostImportant_dict" and the "mostImportant_descriptor" (ConfigVariables). For example, for the WindChill phrase, we only want to report the sub-phrase that has the lowest value. So instead of "Wind chill readings 5 below to 15 below in the early morning then zero to 10 below in the afternoon, " we report "Lowest wind chill readings 5 below to 15 below in the early morning."
