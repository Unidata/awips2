Now we will learn about Narrative products and how they are constructed.  First, we will learn about the Forecast Narrative Engine which interprets the narrative definition, samples and analyzes the data to produce a narrative tree and statistics dictionary.  We will examine the processing rules that result in a finished narrative product and various narrative strategies employed to express the many complexities and dependencies inherent in narrative products.  Finally, we will tie all of this together as we learn about the steps to construct a narrative phrase.
