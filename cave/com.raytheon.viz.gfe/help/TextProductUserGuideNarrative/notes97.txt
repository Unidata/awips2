For example, if we have a temporal resolution of [6] in a 12-hour period, we will end up with 2 sub-phrase nodes, one for the first 6 hours and one for the second.  The "subPhraseSetUp" method then sets various attributes on the phrase and sub-phrase nodes.  The "descriptor" is from the "phrase_descriptor_dict" for the first weather element. The connectorMethod and elementInfoList are stored for subsequent use, as are the elementInfo and elementName for the first element.  At the sub-phrase level, we store the elementName, timeRange.  In addition, we create and store a statistics dictionary which is specific to this sub-phrase timeRange and areaLabel.
