<p><p><big>It also has the Trigger Condition that all sub-phrases must have the "words" attribute set.  Recall that the wordMethods set the "words" attribute to "null" if the values are below the null_nlValue.  The job of "fillNulls" is to fill in the appropriate words using the "first_null_phrase" and "null_phrase" values.  After doing so, it sets the "null" attribute for the sub-phrase to 1 for subsequent processing.  This cannot be done in the wordMethod since, at that point, we cannot be sure whether the sub-phrase will end up being the first. Finally, we must collapse empty word sub-phrases.<br><br><br></big>
