The Trigger Condition is that all sub-phrases have the "words" attribute set. There is a check to handle "until" phrasing which, if required, is handled by the "assembleUntilSubPhrases" method.  Otherwise, we loop through the sub-phrases including a phrase descriptor for the first non-null sub-phrase and a connector for the rest.  We also add a time descriptor for flagged sub-phrases.  Finally, we set the "words" attribute for the phrase and return self.DONE().
