Here is the phraseList for the weather_phrase.  Note that it is similar to the standard_vector_phrase methods.  The main difference is in the consolidation methods.  The "preProcessWx" method organizes the weather subkeys according to their time span. It combines weather types with similar coverages.  The "separateNonPrecip" method splits off precip-related weather types from non-precip types.  If visibility is constant throughout the time period, it is separated out into its own phrase.  The weather phrase can also be adjusted if there are too many sub-phrases.  In this case, the temporal resolution will be reduced to make a more desirable phrase.
