So now we can see how these rules work to produce the desired result.  In Pass 1, the pre-requisites for assembling components and assembling phrases are not met I.e. there are no words set at the component or phrase levels.  We CAN set up, combine, and consolidate the sub-phrases, however.  We cannot assemble the sub-phrases yet since no sub-phrase words have been set, but we can create the words for each sub-phrase in turn.  In Pass 2, we can assemble the sub-phrase words.  By Pass 3, we assemble the phrase words and finally in Pass 4, we are ready to assemble the component words.
