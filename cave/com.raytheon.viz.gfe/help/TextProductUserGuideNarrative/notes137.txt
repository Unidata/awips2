The "separateNonPrecip" method uses the helper method "splitWxPhrase" which takes the tree, sub-phrase, and 2 lists.  The first lists weather subkeys that should be disabled in the original phrase.  The second lists weather subkeys that should be disabled in a new weather phrase.  The "getStatDict" method then uses these attribute lists to filter out weather subkeys that are disabled. This works similarly to the "disabledElements" list mentioned previously.
