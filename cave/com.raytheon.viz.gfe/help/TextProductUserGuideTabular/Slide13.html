<p><p><big>Smart Text Products inherit from the TextRules and SampleAnalysis libraries.  Within the libraries, variables, in general, start with lower case letters and can use capitals and underscores to delineate words.  We opt in favor of longer names to for clarity and readability of the code.  It it imperative that when you create new variables or methods in the Standard or Local Text Product files, you begin their names with an underscore.  This will ensure that you are not inadvertently overriding a variable or method from the Infrastructure which could break your product or produce undesirable results.<br><br><br></big>
