The "getAreaList" method accesses the list of  (edit area object, label) pairs over which the product will be run.  This list is created by the TextFormatter infrastructure BEFORE the Smart Text Product is called.  It is created from the "defaultEditAreas" list or the Combinations file for the product.  The Infrastructure does the work of interpreting the text edit area names and fetching the edit area information  from the server to create the edit area object which subsequent steps require.
