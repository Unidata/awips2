In the General Set-up section, we have the "type" which must be "table", the "displayName" to appear in the Local Formatter dialog, and the "outputFile".  Simple Tables involve Time Periods, Edit Areas, and Weather Elements.  The Table Layout specifies which will be listed down the rows, which across the columns and which will be constant for each instance of the table.  In this example, the table is produced for one time period so it is the constantVariable.  We can also specify text strings to be included before and after the product.  These strings can have special keywords which are described in the template documentation.
