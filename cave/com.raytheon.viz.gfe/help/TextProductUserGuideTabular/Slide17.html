<p><p><big>The Smart Text Products create and manipulate these objects.  Having familiarity with them will help you understand the "language" of the text products.  Edit Areas are Python class objects which have attribute methods such as the edit area name and data points.  The AreaList is a list of (edit area object, label) tuples.  We'll look more closely at Time Ranges in a moment.  The AnalysisList specifies weather elements and analysis methods.  The HistoSampler is complicated structure containing the raw histograms from sampling the data.  You will not need to access information inside the HistoSampler, but will pass it on to helper methods to perform the analysis.  Finally, the StatDict and StatList contain the results of the analysis for each weather element.  We'll see them in more detail later.<br><br><br></big>
