<h1 class="3Heading"><a name="PickUpValueDialog"></a>Pickup Value Dialog</h1>
<a name="pgfId=176376"></a>The Pickup Value dialog is opened from the
Edit
Actions Dialog. It allows you to set the value that will be
used by Assign Value Tool for any loaded Weather Element. Optionally,
you
can choose to Assign the value you have chosen by clicking on the
"Assign"
button.
<p>The dialog displays a color scale, and the name of the Weather
Element
is shown at the top of the dialog. There are four different types
of dialogs: Scalar, Vector, Weather, and Discrete.
</p>
<h2><a name="ScalarPickUpValueDialog"></a>Scalar PickUp Value Dialog</h2>
There are two ways to set the current pickup value. MB1 click or drag
will
set the pickup value to whatever value you clicked. Or, if you
click
MB1 in the box labeled "Enter Value", you can enter a value using the
keyboard.
<p><img src="images/DialogPickUpValueScalar.jpg" nosave=""></p>
<p>The scaling can be changed by MB2 click over the scale. The
MB3
Pop-Up menu that allows you to modify the display of the color scale is currently
not available from the Pickup Value dialog.
Select one of the follow Pop-Up menu items to modify the scale display
accordingly.
</p>
<h2><a name="VectorPickUpValueDialog"></a>Vector PickUp Value Dialog</h2>
The vector pick up value dialog contains an entry field for direction
and
magnitude, selectors for the <a
 href="GFEMainMenu.html#EditingPreferences">vector
edit mode</a>, and a graphical entry for direction and magnitude.
The direction and magnitude may be entered in the entry fields at any
time,
regardless of the vector edit mode. The vector edit mode affects the
way
the direction and magnitude are specified using the graphical entry
method
and the way some edit tools behave when editing vector data.
<p>The graphical entry contains a circle representing the current
magnitude,
a wind barb and arrow representing both magnitude and direction, and a
meter readout also representing both magnitude and direction.
</p>
<p>The user can choose to set the direction through the graphical entry
in either the "to" or the "from" direction by starting the operation in
the appropriate hemisphere. If you start the entry operation
within
90 degrees of either side of the arrow, then you are specifying the
"to"
direction. If you start the entry operation within 90 degrees of
either
side of the wind barb, then you are specifying the "from" direction.
</p>
<p>Clicking or dragging in the graphic entry will set the magnitude and
direction, if the <a href="GFEMainMenu.html#EditingPreferences">vector
edit mode</a> is set to Both. If the vector edit mode is set to
Magnitude
Only, then only the magnitude may be set. If the vector edit mode
is set to Direction Only, then only the direction may be set. The
direction is determined by the angle from the center of the
circle.
The magnitude is determined by the distance your cursor is from the
center
of the circle.

<a name="EditAreaQueryDialog"></a>Edit Area and Query Dialog</h1>
Opens a dialog that allows you to load previously defined edit areas,
and
construct query expressions that create edit areas. One way to
define
an edit area is by defining a query. A query is a mathematical
expression
that describes one or more weather conditions (T &lt; 32, Rain, Hail,
Snow,
and so forth).
<p>When a query is applied against a particular grid, its weather
conditions
are searched for. The result is a new edit area that consists of all
the
areas that match the query's weather conditions.
</p>
<p><img src="images/DialogEditArea.jpg" nosave=""><br>
</p>
<h2>Main Window</h2>
There are several windows and buttons on the Edit Area and Query
Dialog:
<ul>
  <li class="4Heading">Query -- The query expression.</li>
  <li>Groups -- Edit Area Group(s). You may select which edit
areas you
wish to view in the Edit Areas window. Edit Areas that are not part of
any group are displayed under "Misc".</li>
  <li>Edit Areas -- Named edit areas that have been saved.</li>
  <li>Weather Elements -- Weather elements that can be used in
the
query
expression.</li>
  <li>Active Edit Area -- Displays the current edit area. If it
is a query,
the expression will be shown. If it is simply polygons, the word
"Polygon"
will be displayed.</li>
  <li>Clear Query -- Clears the query expression.</li>
  <li>Recall Query -- Displays a list of past queries (limit 10).
If
chosen,
the query will appear in the Query window. The list will not contain
duplicates.</li>
  <li>Undo Edit Area -- Reverts to previous edit area.</li>
  <li>Convert to Location -- If the current edit area is defined
by a
query,
converts it to a polygon. After this operation, the edit area is a
static
set of points and will not change with the data.</li>
  <li>Submit -- Submit the query for evaluation. Clears the query

<h3><a name="coq"></a>Components of Queries</h3>
You can create a new query by entering one or more weather conditions.
Query values can combine any number of the following:
<ul>
  <li>Named Edit Areas</li>
  <li>Weather Element relational&shy;expressions</li>
  <li>Weather type relational&shy;expressions</li>
</ul>
Queries are written in numerical python, and thus the syntax is similar
to <a href="SmartTools.html">smart tools</a> and <a
 href="SmartInit.html">smart
initialization</a>. An edit area and a weather element are
basically
Python variables. An edit area is represented by a mask of bits
which
make up the edit area. A weather element is a numerical grid for
SCALAR, a tuple of two numerical grids for VECTOR, and a grid and a key
for both WEATHER and DISCRETE.
<p>Parenthesis are very important when using the OR ('|') or AND
('&amp;')
operators since these operators have a high order of precedence.
The following statements are not equal:
</p>
<center>
<p>T &gt; 32 | Topo &gt; 7000
<br>
(T &gt; 32&gt; | (Topo &gt; 7000)</p>
</center>
<p>The following are valid queries for SCALAR data:
<br>
&nbsp;
<table nosave="" border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T &gt; 32</td>
      <td>Temperature greater than 32</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T &lt; 32</td>
      <td>Temperature less than 32</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T == 32</td>
      <td>Temperature equal to 32 (exactly)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T != 32</td>
      <td>Temperature not equal to 32 (exactly)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T &gt;= 32</td>
      <td>Temperature greater than or equal to 32</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T &lt;= 32</td>
      <td>Temperature less than or equal to 32</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>More complicated queries may also be performed such as the following
on SCALAR data (note that parenthesis must be provided):
<br>
<br>
<table nosave="" border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>T - Td &gt; 10</td>
      <td>Dew Point Depression is greater than 10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>T - 10 &gt; Td</td>
      <td>Dew Point Depression is greater than 10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(QPF &gt; 0.10) &amp; (PoP &lt; 70)</td>
      <td>QPF greater than 0.10" and PoP less than 70%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(T &gt; 32) &amp; (Topo &gt; 5000) &amp; (Topo &lt; 7000)
&amp; Colorado</td>
      <td>Temperatures less than 32, with topography between 5000ft and
7000ft,
in the state of Colorado.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>Vector queries can be done on the magnitude and the direction
component,
note that Wind[0] refers to the magnitude and Wind[1] refers to the
direction,
as in smart initialization and smart tools:
<br>
<br>
<table nosave="" border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Wind[0] &gt; 25</td>
      <td>Wind speed greater than 25</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(Wind[0] &gt; 25 &amp; (Wind[0] &lt; 40)</td>
      <td>Wind speed between 25 and 40</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>(Wind[0] &gt; 25 &amp; (Wind[1] &gt; 90 &amp; (Wind[1] &lt;
180)</td>
      <td>Wind speed greater than 25, with the direction between 90 and
180.&nbsp;
The direction is the "FROM" direction.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>Weather and Discrete queries are performed using the <b><i>mask</i></b>
function. The mask button on the dialog simply saves you from
typing
the word mask. The mask function is in this form:
mask(weatherElementName,
stringMatch, regExpressionYesNo). Normally you don't provide a
regular
expression so the mask is in this form: mask(weatherElementName,
stringMatch). Here are some examples of using the mask function
for
Weather and Discrete:
<br>
<br>
<table nosave="" border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>mask(Wx, ":R:")</td>
      <td>Wx&nbsp; with Rain (R), with any coverage, visibility,
attributes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>mask(Wx, ":R:") | mask(Wx, ":RW:")</td>
      <td>Wx&nbsp; with Rain (R) or Rain Showers (RW)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>mask(Wx, "Sct:RW:")</td>
      <td>Wx with Scattered Rain Showers</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>mask(Highlights, "WntrStmWRN")</td>
      <td>Highlights with Winter Storm Warning</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>mask(Wx, "Sct:RW:+:&lt;NoVis&gt;")</td>
      <td>Wx with Scattered Heavy Rain Showers, No Visibility</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>mask(wx, "^Sct:RW:+:&lt;NoVis&gt;:\Z", 1)</td>
      <td>Wx with ONLY Scattered Heavy Rain Showers, No Visibility.
Note that
this is regular expression syntax with the '^' matching the beginning
of
the phrase and the '\Z' matching the end of the phrase.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>The mask function uses substring searches of the keys to determine
what
grid points match the query. The PickUp Value and Wx/Dis Values
menus
provide a quick way to enter the pick up value or an exact match for
weather
and discrete weather elements. Note that since substring
comparisions
are performed, providing a query of mask(Wx, "Sct:RW:+:") will match
any
grid point that has Sct:RW:+: in it, so it will also match grid points
that have a weather key of:
"Iso:T:&lt;NoInten&gt;:&lt;NoVis&gt;:^Sct:RW:+:&lt;NoVis&gt;".&nbsp;
The only way to find grid points that ONLY have the Sct:RW:+: in it
without
others is to use the regular expression option as shown above in the
table.
</p>
<p>The create mask menu option provides an easy way to select a set of
Wx or Discrete characteristics to search.
</p>
<p>Combining queries are performed through the "|" OR and
"&amp;"
AND operators. Since the syntax in the query is numpy, there
are many other possibilities for the syntax. Here is an example
of
using the python absolute() function to calculate the absolute value of
an expression. In this case, we are selecting all T grid points
that
differ from the AVN model greater than 5 degrees:
</p>
