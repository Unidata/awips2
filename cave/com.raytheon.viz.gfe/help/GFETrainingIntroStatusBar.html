<hr width="100%">
<p>AlertViz replaces the Status Bar in AWIPS2.  It is shared among all
visualization components and displayed separately from CAVE. For GFE, it
is used to report routine,
significant, and urgent messages. There are two display areas in AlertViz, 
one for general GFE messages and one for ISC and Smart Initialization
status messages. GFE time display and progress bar have been moved to the 
bottom of the GFE CAVE display. Refer to the <a href="StatusBar.html">AlertViz
documentation</a> for more details.
