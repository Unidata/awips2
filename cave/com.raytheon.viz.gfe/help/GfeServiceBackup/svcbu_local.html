<H3><a name="Export_Config">EXPORTING YOUR LOCAL CONFIGURATION TO THE CENTRAL SERVER</a></H3>

<p>This action should be performed by the GFE focal point whenever your local configuration has
been changed to ensure that the backup site will have your latest configuration should you 
need to enter service backup.
</p>

<p>NOTE: The "Export Configuration" button will only be displayed if the Service Backup 
Dialog is started by a user having the GFE focalPoint permission. 
Contact your AWIPS administrator if you need to have this permission assigned to you.
