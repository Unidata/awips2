<li>Verify that the banner at the top of the Service Backup 
Dialog reads &quot;YOU ARE NOT IN BACKUP MODE&quot;&nbsp; or does not include the failed site
you wish to back up under "YOU ARE BACKING UP". 
<br>
If the failed site is listed you may want to 
<a href="#HOW_TO_EXIT_SERVICE_BACKUP" style="text-decoration: none">exit</a> and re-enter service backup to ensure you are using the failed site's latest configuration.</li>

<li>Select the failed site from the drop down next to the "Enter Service Backup" button. 
The sites you commonly back up will appear at the top of the list.
</li>

<li>Check the boxes next to any desired start up options:</li>
<ol type="a">
<li><b>Import Forecast Grids:</b> Automatically import the failed site's digital forecast grids. 
If you are entering service backup to issue an urgent warning product you may wish to skip 
this step. You can import the grids after after entering service backup using the 
<a href="#Import_Grids" style="text-decoration: none">"Import Forecast Grids"</a> button.
</li>

<li><b>Troubleshooting Mode:</b> You should check this box if you are activating the site 
for testing and intending to enter service backup. This will disable ISC and 
VTEC Active Table sharing since you are not acting as the failed site.
</li>

<li><b>Automatically Start GFE:</b> Checking this box will automatically start a GFE session 
for the failed site as you enter service backup. You can also do this after entering 
service backup using the 
<a href="#Starting_GFE" style="text-decoration: none">"Start GFE Session"</a> button. 
</li>
</ol>
