<br>
<br>
<font face="New Century Schoolbook, Times New Roman, serif">Sometimes you have complex combinations 
of weather and you want to remove just one of the “pieces” of weather.  It is difficult to do using 
the standard Assign_Value dialog for weather, without messing up other weather combinations, or 
having to do the operation multiple times for each different combination of weather.  The RemoveWx 
tool makes it easy to remove a particular weather string from any area of weather.</font>

the Procedure Works</font><span style="font-weight: bold;">
</span></big></big><br>
<br>
<font face="New Century Schoolbook, Times New Roman, serif">Lets say we have a complex combination 
of rain/snow (with different probability values) and we have patchy fog combined with both of these 
weather types:<br><br>
<img alt="RemoveWx" src="images/RemoveWx.png"></font>
<br>
<br>
<font face="New Century Schoolbook, Times New Roman, serif">Now, lets say that we want to remove 
the fog.  If we do a query to find all the pixels that contain fog, we cannot simply set the 
values to rain, because we have the fog combined with rain in some areas and snow in others 
(not to mention that we have it combined with ‘chance rain/snow’ in some areas and ‘likely 
rain/snow’ in others).  If we use the ‘select homogeneous area’ tool we will have to do this 
several times to find all the areas of fog combined with other things. When we start the RemoveWx 
tool, it presents a dialog where we specify which weather we want to remove:<br>
<img alt="RemoveWx" src="images/RemoveWx1.png"></font>
<br>
<br>
<font face="New Century Schoolbook, Times New Roman, serif">We just need to select F for Fog:<br>
<img alt="RemoveWx" src="images/RemoveWx2.png"></font>
<br>
<br>
<font face="New Century Schoolbook, Times New Roman, serif">Then run the tool, and all mention of 
Fog is removed, while preserving all the other weather combinations:<br>
<img alt=RemoveWx" src="images/RemoveWx3.png"><br><br>
The tool also works if you specify an edit area, so that, for example, you could remove fog from 
only some areas, while leaving it in others.  Say, for example, that you define an edit area like 
this:<br>
<img alt="RemoveWx" src="images/RemoveWx4.png"><br><br>
And then remove the fog.  The result is:<br>
<img alt="RemoveWx" src="images/RemoveWx5.png"><br><br>
There are many cases where you want to do this sort of editing operation: removing thunderstorms from 
an area of showers, removing freezing rain from an area of rain, etc.</font>
