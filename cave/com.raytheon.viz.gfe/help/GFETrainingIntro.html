<p>The Graphical Forecast Editor (GFE) is a grid-based
editing
system that provides various tools to forecasters that allow them to
edit
gridded fields of sensible weather elements. While this training guide
describes most of the functionality within the GFE, it is not
comprehensive.
Its purpose is to familiarize users with GFE concepts and tools
in
order that they might use the GFE to generate gridded forecast
products.
<p>This training guide is divided into several sections. If you
are
new to the GFE , it is recommended that you follow the guide in the
proper
order, since terms and concepts learned in the beginning are used
throughout
the guide. This section is intended to get you familiar with the
major components of the GFE. More detailed descriptions of each
component
can be found in subsequent sections.

throughout
this guide, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with them now.</div>
