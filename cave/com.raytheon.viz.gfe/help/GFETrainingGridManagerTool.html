<div class="Body">The Grid Manager contains many functions to
manipulate
whole grids, but generally not the gridded values inside them. Using
the
Grid Manager you can:</div>
<ul>
  <li class="Bulleted">Control the Spatial Editor display while
selecting a grid to edit</li>
  <li class="Bulleted">Copy model-derived grids into your forecast</li>
  <li class="Bulleted">Create new grids from scratch</li>
  <li class="Bulleted">Delete a grid</li>
  <li class="Bulleted">Copy a grid</li>
  <li class="Bulleted">Paste a grid</li>
  <li class="Bulleted">Split a grid in time</li>
  <li class="Bulleted">Fragment a grid in time</li>
  <li class="Bulleted">Assign Default Value to every gridpoint in the
grid</li>
  <li class="Bulleted">Stretch the time over which a grid is valid</li>
  <li class="Bulleted">Interpolate new grids based on the grids that
already exist</li>
  <li class="Bulleted">Run selected Smart Tools</li>
  <li class="Bulleted">Send single ISC (intersite coordination grid)</li>
</ul>
<div class="Body">All of this functionality is accomplished by a single
tool - the Grid Manager Tool, which is always available. The table
below
lists each action and the function it performs. The table substitutes
the
abbreviation MB1 and MB2 for Mouse Button 1 and Mouse Button 2,
respectively.</div>

<div class="Body">In addition to the main Grid Manager edit tool
actions,
the Mouse Button 3 (MB3) pop-up menu offers many more edit operations.
When using these operations, keep in mind that they apply to a single
grid
(or place-holder for a grid) - the grid under the cursor - when you
perform
the operation. Operations include deleting, fragmenting,
splitting,
copying, and pasting a grid.&nbsp; Other edit operations permit
assigning
values to a grid, creating a grid from scratch, and running selected
smart
tools on the grid. Refer to the <a
 href="Button3Popups.html#GridManager">Grid
Manager Button 3 Popups documentation</a> for more details.</div>
