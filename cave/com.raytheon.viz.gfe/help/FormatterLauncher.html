The Formatter Launcher Dialog is used to define zone groupings, queue
formatters for execution, monitor their progress, display and edit the
final product, and send the product to AWIPS for transmission.<br>

The Formatter Launcher consists of the main menu bar, product tabs and
product canvas area, and status bar.<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Components"
 src="images/FormatterLauncher1.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Main Menu Bar</h3>
<h4>Products</h4>
The products menu permits selection of the products to appear in the
panes. The menu is divided into "Site-level" products, then
Hazard and Civil Emergency, then Baseline, Regional, and Hazard
backup product configurations, and then the Product Editor / Make
Correction
tab.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Each selection will
open a new tab.&nbsp; The Product Editor / Make Correction tab brings
up an
empty editor, allowing for loading existing products from the AWIPS
text database and making corrections to a product. <br>
<br>
<h4>Data Source</h4>
The data source menu allows the forecaster to change the source
database for all products to one of the four options: Official,
Fcst, ISC, or Default. The Default setting uses the database
definition contained within each formatter to determine which database
should be used as a data source.<br>
<br>
The default data source is configured within each
formatter's definition section as one of the following:<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">Definition['database']
= "Official"</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">Definition['database']
= "Fcst"</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">Definition['database']
= "ISC"<br>
</span></div>
<br>
Note in <a href="GFEStartup.html#special">GFE PRACTICE mode</a>, the
only Data Source is the Practice Forecast database; in <a
 href="GFEStartup.html#special">GFE TEST mode</a>, the only Data Source
is the Test Forecast database.<br>
<h4>Processor</h4>
Formatters execute either on the server platform or the local
platform. Better performance for the local GFE and faster
formatter execution should be realized when the processor is set to
"Server". This item is not configurable on a per-product
basis. The default is "Server". Setting the item to "Local"
will run the formatters locally. The default may be changed
through the gfe configuration entry <a
 href="gfeConfig_formatterLauncher.html#Processor">FormatterLauncherDialog_Processor</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Issued By</h4>
The Issued By option brings up a dialog allowing the forecaster to
enter his/her site identifier (3-letters).&nbsp; The entry is only used
when the site is performing service backup for another
site. Defining an "Issued By" entry will result in the
generated products containing the Issued By statement in the product
header.<br>
<br>
<h4>Help</h4>
The Help menu simply provides a color legend for the Product Tabs. <br>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Product Tabs</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;"></span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;"></span>There
is a product tab for each selected entry in the Products
Selector. Clicking on one of the tabs will then display that
product's Product Canvas Area. The Product Canvas Area contains
the zone combiner (if applicable), editor window, output log, and
several other controls. The color state of the buttons indicate
whether the product is queued, running, or finished as shown below:<br>
<br>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">

    <tr>

<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Product
Canvas Area</span></span></h3>
The Product Canvas Area appears for each product that has been
selected.&nbsp; Use the Product Tabs to display the specific Product
Canvas Area of interest. The Product Canvas consists of a control
panel and the canvas area. Depending upon the state of the
product, some of the controls are dimmed and not accessible.<br>
<br>
<img alt="Controls" src="images/FormatterLauncher2.png"><br>
The controls perform the following functions:<br>

<h2><a name="ZoneCombiner"></a>Zone Combiner</h2>
The Zone Combiner is used to view and modify the set of combined zones
for the product.&nbsp; Not all products support zone selection.&nbsp;
In the case of a product that doesn't support a zone selection, the
zone combiner selection button is dimmed.&nbsp; The Zone Combiner
contains a menu bar, the canvas depicting the zones, and a label
containing the product name and combinations filename, and the Apply
Zone Combo button.<br>

Unlike most configuration files throughout GFESuite which adhere to the
BASE/SITE/User concept,&nbsp; the Zone Combiner color table, saved

<h3>Zone Combiner Menus</h3>
<h2><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></h2>
<h4>Combo Sets</h4>
The combo sets menu contains three entries as shown in the following

<br>
Combinations are available based on the base map background in use for
each formatter.&nbsp; Each formatter requiring zone combinations
contains a definition defining the map background.&nbsp; An example is:
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;">Definition["mapNameForCombinations"]
= "Zones_BOU"</span> . If the definition is missing, then zone
combinations may not be changed for the product.<br>
<br>
The Combo Sets menu entry is dimmed if there are no combinations being
shown in the zone combiner.<br>
<br>

<h4>Combo Actions</h4>
The Combo Actions menu controls the Zone Combiner and provides commonly
used actions, such as clear.<br>

<br>
The Combo Options menu entry is dimmed if there are no combinations
being shown in the zone combiner.<br>
<br>
<h4>Zoom</h4>
The map background in the zone combiner may be zoomed. The scroll
bars around the map are used to pan the display. The
options on the zoom menu control the amount of zooming, from "No Zoom"
to various zoom factors.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Zone Combiner Canvas</h3>
<br>
The canvas is the drawing area of the zone combiner.
Through a series of clicks and drags, the set of zone combinations may
be edited.<br>
<br>
The canvas may be resized. Its initial size is configurable
through the gfe configuration file. By default, the zone
combiner dialog is about 80% the height and width of the display.<br>
<br>
<h4>Drawing a New Combination</h4>
Using MB1, press over a zone that is "grayed-out" which represents an
individual zone, and drag through that zone into zones you wish to be
part of the same combination. The "zone color" is chosen
automatically for you. You can change the zone colors if desired
through the <a href="FormatterLauncher.html#ZoneColors">Zone Colors....</a>
menu entry.<br>
<br>
<h4>Picking Up a Zone Combination</h4>
A MB2 click over a zone will "pick-up" that zone's configuration.
This is useful for adding another zone to a combination or changing the
existing configuration of a zone to that which was "picked-up".<br>
<br>
<h4>Adding Another Zone to a Combination - Contiguous</h4>
Using MB1, press over the zone which you want to extend. Drag
through the new zones (whether they are already assigned or not doesn't
matter). As you drag through the zones, they become part of the
same combination.<br>
<br>
<h4>Adding Another Zone to a Combination - Non-Contiguous</h4>
MB2 click over a zone in the combination you wish to extend to pick up
its value. MB1 click over the zone you wish to add. You may need
to MB1 click more than once.<br>
<br>
<h4>Toggling Zones</h4>
MB1 clicks will toggle a zone from the combination, to a new group, and
to "off" or non-included zone. If the "Include
All Zones" is selected, then the clicks will toggle between the
combination and a new group.<br>
<br>
<h3>Apply Zone Combo <br>
</h3>
This button is enabled when the zone combination has been modified but
not saved.&nbsp; Press this button to save the zone combination to the
server.<br>
<br>
<h3><br>
</h3>
<h3>Proper Formatter and Configuration Setup</h3>
<br>
The zone combiner requires certain Definition section items to be set
up in each formatter. It also requires <a
 href="mapConfig.html">map backgrounds</a> to be configured properly in
the EDEX.<br>
<br>
<h4>Definition section of product<br>

</table>
Note: the combinations file must be read-write in the server in order
for the user to modify the zone combinations. If a combinations
file is marked read-only, then the zone combiner will not be displayed.<br>
<br>
<h4>Map Configuration in EDEX<br>
</h4>
The map background configuration defines the editAreaName for certain
map backgrounds. If this attribute is defined, then edit areas
will be automatically generated for the map background, based on the
attributes specified. The Zone Combiner uses the edit area names
associated with each shape in the map background to map combination
edit area names to map background names. If your
combinations file uses other names, then the zone combiner will reject
those names and start out with an empty set of zone combinations.<br>

<h2><a name="ProductEditor"></a>Product Editor</h2>
The Product Editor is used to display the finished product to the
forecaster, and then allows the forecaster to edit, save to a file,
save as a draft, store, and
transmit it.. It consists of a menu bar, the text editor,
and to save a draft and transmit the product.<br>
<br>
Some fields in the product editor may appear in a different color
(default is blue). These fields are "Locked" and cannot be edited
by the forecaster. NWS policy requires quality control on
the UGC, VTEC, and other components of the product thus requires that
the forecaster not be
able to edit that field. Some fields may appear in another color
(default is red). These fields are "framing codes" and indicate
to the forecaster that the text within the framing codes and the
framing code deliminators must be edited/removed by the forecaster.<br>
<br>
A special entry on the Products menu called "Product Editor / Make
Correction" brings up
a blank slate. You can load files from the AWIPS Text Database, text
file on disk, type an original product, or make a correction to an
existing product.<br>

<h3>Text Window</h3>
The Text Window is the text editor. Clicking on a location will
set the cursor position to that location. Typing will then insert
characters at that point. Dragging over text will select
the text, which then can be used in cut/copy/paste operations.<br>
<br>
The WMOID block, headlines, and UGC blocks cannot be edited and appear
in a different color
(configurable through the GFE configuration file). The UGC block
consists of the UGC codes, any VTEC lines, the list of zone names, the
list of city names, and the date-time group.<br>
<br>
A MB3 popup menu is available that duplicates the functions found on
the menu bar.<br>
<h3>Buttons</h3>
There are usually three buttons available: Save File..., Store, and
Transmit. During <a href="GFEStartup.html#special">GFE Practice
mode</a>, the buttons are labeled the same, but have a different

Definition['awipsWANPil'] part of the formatter. If live
transmission is enabled, then this button is RED. If live
transmission is disabled, as in PRACTICE mode, then this button is

the "DELAYED" wording to be appended to the product's MND header.&nbsp;
Changing the product to "res" indicates this is a retransmission, no
"bbb" field is included in the WMO line, but the MND header will
contain "RESENT".&nbsp; "rou" indicates a normal

<h3>Transmit Dialog</h3>
The Transmit Dialog is presented when the user chooses the "Transmit"
button.&nbsp; The user can change the AWIPS Product ID if necessary,
and
then presses the "Store" button to store the product.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
Transmit
Countdown timer counts down from 5 seconds giving the user the chance
to abort the transmit operation.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the operation is not
aborted, the
product will be transmited to the AWIPS WAN.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="TransmitDialog"
 src="images/TransmitDialog.png" style="width: 464px; height: 242px;"><br>
</div>
<br>
If the transmit was not successful, then an error dialog is raised
which contains the traceback on the transmit failure.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Changes to Product when Transmitting, Storing, or Saving</h3>
Whenever products are transmitted, stored, or saved, certain
modifications are made to the product text (Except as noted for
Corrections below):<br>
<ul>
  <li>The issuance time in the CI header is updated to the present time.</li>
  <li>The descriptive text indicating the issuance time, such as 400 AM
MST THU DEC 25 2004, is updated to the present time.</li>
  <li>The product purge times for each segment are updated.</li>
  <li>VTEC codes that have an explicit starting time that is now in the
past, are updated to the present time.</li>
</ul>
For Corrections (from the Product Editor tab):<br>
<ul>
  <li>The MND time stamp remains unchanged.</li>
  <li>The product purge times for each segment are updated.</li>
  <li>VTEC codes that have an explicit starting time that is now in the
past, are updated to the present time.</li>
</ul>
In addition, other checks are made:<br>
<ul>
  <li>If any VTEC string ending time is now earlier than the present
time, the operation is aborted and the product is invalidated.</li>
  <li>If a VTEC notification is received that your WFO has updated some
of the VTEC strings in the product, usually by running and transmitting
another product in the office, then the operation is aborted and the
product is invalidated.</li>
  <li>All text is changed to Upper Case, per the 10-1701 product
directive.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
If the product is invalidated, you can still save the text to a
temporary file or Save Draft,&nbsp; but will be unable to transmit it
or store
it.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will need to regenerate the product.<br>
<br>
Once a product is transmitted, you can no longer transmit the same
product.&nbsp; Instead you need to re-run the
formatter.<br>
<br>
<h3>Locked Out Fields and Editing Headlines</h3>
Due to NWS Quality Control rules, the CI, MND, VTEC lines, UGC lines,
Zone and City Names, Issuance Date Lines, and Headlines are locked and
cannot be edited by the forecaster.<br>
<br>
Headlines do allow additional phrasing to be added at the end of each
Headline.&nbsp; This is to accomondate specific phrases such as "ABOVE
9000 FEET".&nbsp;&nbsp; The text must be added right before the "..."
or "TEST..." in the headline.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your additional headlines, or
added words to existing headlines should not contain any of the
following words, or your headline will lock. <br>
<br>
The words that should NOT be used in local headlines or added phrases
to headlines are:<br>
<ul>
  <li>AFTERNOON</li>
  <li>CANCELLED</li>

This example illustrates adding words to the end of the headline.&nbsp;
The blue text is locked and cannot be edited.&nbsp; The black text is
editable.&nbsp; The cursor was placed right before the "..." and the
user typed <span style="font-weight: bold;">ABOVE 9000 FEET</span>.<br>
<br>

<br>
It is important to realize that some headlines that are edited by the
user will lock and thus not be correctable.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
forecaster uses different words that what is expected the software will
not be able to distinguish the words from the non-editable portion of
the headline.<br>
<br>
Automatic word wrap is disabled in the headlines for technical reasons
and thus the forecaster will need to provide the appropriate word
wrapping.<br>

<h3>Using Load Draft and Save Draft</h3>
The Load Draft / Save Draft feature provides several benefits:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Provides a quick way to save a copy of the current product "just
in case" a system problem or editing mistake is made.</li>
  <li>Provides a way for one forecaster to edit part of the product,
and then hand off the product to another forecaster for review or
further editing.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
The saved draft is put into the EDEX 
/awips2/edex/data/utility/cave_static/site/SITE/gfe/drafts directory and is
named via the Definition['awipsWANpil'] contained in the product
definition. The saved information consists of the product text
and the product definition. The product definition contains
important attributes for the product, such as line length and segment
expiration time characteristics. EDEX monitors
incoming VTEC notifications and compares them to the contents of the
draft products and invalidates the draft products if there is a match;
this prevents the loading of a draft that might contain invalid VTEC
and then transmitting a product with invalid VTEC. Loading a
draft that has been invalidated will result in the editor being
disabled and a message indicating that there is a possibility of
invalid VTEC so the product must be regenerated.<br>
<br>
Once the draft is saved, the same forecaster or different forecasters
may load the draft into their product editor. Loading a
draft is accomplished by selecting Products -&gt; XXX in the Formatter
Launcher, where XXX is the product name, to create the product
pane. Then the forecaster clicks on the Load Draft (<img
 alt="LoadDraft" src="images/loadDraft.gif"
 style="width: 22px; height: 22px;">) button and the previously saved
text and its product definition are loaded into the editor.<br>
<br>
The forecaster than continues to edit the product until it is ready for
transmission.<br>
<br>
Drafts are automatically purged from the server when the segment
expiration time has been reached.<br>
<br>
<span style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">NOTE: Due to VTEC QC
requirements, and the calculations of segment expiration times, it is
NOT recommended to use the Save File... and Open File..., nor Store...
and Load Product... capabilities to faciliate multiple forecasters
editing the product.&nbsp; The VTEC QC will be bypassed and the segment
expiration times may be miscalculated since the product definition will
not be reinstated from the plain text that was previously saved.</span><br>
<h3>Making Corrections - from the Product Editor tab<br>
</h3>
The Product Editor has a correction mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; Correction mode
is entered automatically when a user opens the "Product Editor" tab on
the Formatter Launcher and then uses the "Load Product" option.&nbsp;
This option loads a product from the AWIPS Text Database.&nbsp;&nbsp;
If the user modifies the headline, such as in the following example,
the VTEC action codes for the segment will change to "COR" and the MND
product header will have "...CORRECTED" appended.&nbsp; The "Type"
field in the editor is automatically set to "CCA".&nbsp; The user can
change this to "CCB" or "CCC" if necessary.<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/FormatterLauncher16.png">&nbsp;<br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
Note that using the "Open File" option or no option at all, i.e., blank
editor, will not put the editor into correction mode.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Resent, Updated, Delayed Products<br>
</h3>
The "Type" selector at the bottom of the product editor allows the user
to specify the type of the product as shown below:<br>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-weight: bold;">Type Field<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-weight: bold;">Meaning<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">rou<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Routine product, no additional
words added to the MND header.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">res<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Product that has been
resent.&nbsp; The word RESENT is added to the MND header.&nbsp; This is
only available from the "blank" product editor tab.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">AAA...<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Updated product.&nbsp; The word
UPDATED is added to the MND header.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">RRR...<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Delayed product.&nbsp; The word
DELAYED is added to the MND header.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">CCC...<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Corrected product.&nbsp; In the
blank Product Editor with a loaded product from
the AWIPS text database, the word CORRECTED is added to the MND header
and changes made to any segment text will result in the corresponding
VTEC lines to indicate a "COR" action.&nbsp; This is only available
from the "blank" product editor.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Adding the Update Reason Field</h3>
Some products require adding a reason for the update or
correction.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The user can insert a new line, which will be unlocked, between the UGC
block and the headline.&nbsp; The cursor is placed between the UGC
block
and any headline and then the text is added.&nbsp; Be sure to follow
polices and leave a blank line between the UGC block, the update
reason,
and the headline.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/FormatterLauncher17.png"><br>
</div>
<h3>Framing Codes</h3>
Some of the product formatters and Call To Action statements may
contain "Framing Codes".&nbsp; These codes are highlighted in 'red' by
default in the Product Editor. &nbsp; The product will not be able to
be saved to a file, stored, or transmitted if there are framing codes
present in the product.&nbsp; An example of a product with framing
codes is shown below; the user must remove the frame codes prior to
attempting to save the product.&nbsp;&nbsp; The software only checks
for pairs of framing codes; i.e., if a single framing code is left in
the editor, it may be transmitted.<br>
<br>
In the example below, locked text is shown in blue, and framing code
text is shown in red:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/FormatterLauncher14.png"
 style="width: 608px; height: 250px;"><br>
<br>
<br>
</div>
<h3>Simulated Transmit</h3>
If the GFE is brought up in PRACTICE mode,&nbsp; then the Store and
Transmit are simulated.&nbsp; The dialogs appear different and state
that the simulated store/transmit operations.&nbsp; The dialogs look
like:<br>
<img alt="" src="images/FormatterLauncher10.png"
 style="width: 460px; height: 219px;"><img alt=""
 src="images/FormatterLauncher11.png"
 style="width: 462px; height: 238px;"><br>
<br>
<br>
In PRACTICE mode, the Store operation writes the product to the
GFESuite products/PRACTICE directory as a time-stamped and pil-stamped
file.&nbsp; The first three characters of the AWIPS product id are
ignored.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Transmit operation in practice mode writes the
product to the GFESuite products/PRACTICE directory in the same manner
as the Store operation, and then runs the VTEC Decoder on the product
to simulate sending the product on the WAN and re-receiving
it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="VTEC.html">operational VTEC
active table</a> is not used during practice mode, instead a special
active table called PRACTICE is used.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><br>
</div>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2><a name="OutputLog"></a>Output Log</h2>
The Output Log is available after the product has finished.&nbsp; It
contains the log and print statement output from the formatter
run.&nbsp; It can be used to look for errors that may have
occurred.&nbsp; A Save As... button is available to allow the contents
to be saved to file for later use.<br>
