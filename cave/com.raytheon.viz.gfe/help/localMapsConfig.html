<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
The localMaps.py file provides a mechanism for a site to override entries
in the supplied <a href="mapConfig.html">Maps.py</a> file. New edit areas
may be added, edit areas may be removed from the list, and existing edit area
attributes may be changed. 
Refer to the <a href="mapConfig.html">Maps.py</a>
for the definition of the edit area attributes and how they are used.
This document will explain how to add, remove, and modify edit areas.
<p><b><font color="#ff0000">See the <a
 href="serverConfiguration.html#ServerDatabaseConfigurationModificationOptions">server
configuration overview</a> for information on how to make changes that
are supported to the map backgrounds.</font></b>
</p>
<p></p>
<hr width="100%">
<h2><a name="Format"></a>localMaps.py Format</h2>
<a href="EXAMPLElocalMaps.py">Example localMaps.py configuration file</a>
<h3><a name="Header"></a>Header</h3>
The localMaps.py file must begin with the following line. This line
instructs the software to import all symbols from the primary Maps.py.
Failure to include this line will result in your modifications not being
recognized by the software:
<p><tt>from Maps import *</tt>
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h3><a name="Adding"></a>Adding New Edit Areas</h3>
New edit areas can be added through localMaps.py. Refer to
the syntax requirements of defining a map in the <a
 href="mapConfig.html">Maps.py</a>
document. There is one additional line that is very important to
add (i.e., the append line) in order for the system to recognize the
new
edit areas. It is also important NOT to duplicate the Python variable
name
(i.e., the name left of the equals ("=") sign) of any Python variable
in
the <a href="mapConfig.html">Maps.py</a> file. For example, if a
map is defined as "CWAzones = ..." in <a href="mapConfig.html">Maps.py</a>,
do not create a variable that says "CWAzones = ..." in the localMaps.py
file. Note that this restriction is for adding new edit areas. If you
are overriding the characteristics of edit areas that are already
defined in Maps.py, then you will need to use the same Python variable
name.
<p>Here is an example of including a set of automatic edit areas for counties in Wyoming in group
WYCounties):
</p>
<PRE>
WYcounties = ShapeTable('County')
WYcounties.name = 'WYCounties'
WYcounties.filter(lambda x : x['state'] == "WY") 
WYcounties.editAreaName = ['state','countyname'] 
WYcounties.groupName = 'WYCounties' 
maps.append(WYcounties)
</PRE> 
<p>In the above example, edit areas will be generated for
all counties where attribute STATE equals "WY". The generated edit areas will have names of the form 
STATE_COUNTYNAME
and will be part of the WYCounties edit area group. The very last
line appends this new definition to the list of edit areas to be
generated.
</p>
<p>Note that if your new map background is using a new shapefile, you
will also need to import the shape file into the maps database. 
Refer to section <a href="MapFiles.html">Map Files - Map Background Shapefile Handling</a>
</p>
<p><a href="EXAMPLElocalMapsAdd.py">Example localMaps.py configuration
file</a>
</p>
<h3><a name="Removing"></a>Removing edit areas defined in Maps.py</h3>
Removing a map that is defined in <a href="mapConfig.html">Maps.py</a>,
but not desired is easy. Find the Python variable name of the map
you wish to remove by examining <a href="mapConfig.html">Maps.py</a>.&nbsp;
The python variable name is the name to the left of the "equals" ('=')
sign.
<p>For example, if you did not want to generate the marine
zones,
find the marine zones definition in <a href="mapConfig.html">Maps.py</a>.&nbsp;
There are actually two maps generated. The identifiers are CWAmzones
and
Mzones. The following text would be included within localMaps.py:
</p>
<p><tt>maps.remove(CWAmzones)</tt>
<br>
<tt>maps.remove(Mzones)</tt>
</p>
<p><a href="EXAMPLElocalMapsRemove.py">Example localMaps.py
configuration
file</a>
</p>
<h3><a name="Modifying"></a>Modifying the characteristics of
existing edit areas</h3>
You can modify the following characteristics of the map definition:
<ul>
  <li>name of the database table (ShapeTable parameter)</li>
  <li>name of the map background (.name line)</li>
  <li>filtering (.filter line)</li>
  <li>generation of edit areas (.editAreaName line)</li>
  <li>group name of generated edit areas (.groupName)</li>
</ul>
<h4>
Database Table Name</h4>
<p>If you want to change the name of the database table used for edit area generation, you will
need to remove the existing definition and <a href="#Adding">create a completely new map definition</a>.<br>
</p>
<h4>Name of the Map Background</h4>
The format of the line is identical to that found in Maps.py.&nbsp;
Simply repeat the line you want to change and then put the new map name.
For example, if you want to change the CWAzones map name to MyCWAZones,
you would add the following line to localMaps.py:
<pre>
CWAzones.name = "MyCWAZones"
</pre>
Note: this name is only used in text formatter definitions in the mapNameForCombinations setting.
<h4>Filter Changes</h4>
The format of the line is identical to that found in Maps.py.&nbsp;
Simply repeat the line you want to change and then put in the new filter string.&nbsp;
For example, if you want to change the CWAzones filter from all zones for
the CWA to all zones for the state of Ohio, you would add the following
line to localMaps.py:
<p><tt>CWAzones.filter(lambda x : x['state'] == "OH")</tt>
</p>
<p>You can also use any of the alternate methods of specifying the filter
as described in <a href="mapConfig.html#FilteredMap">Maps.py</a>. This
shows much more complex types of filters than this file.
</p>
<p>If you want to turn filtering off completely for a map, you will need
to remove the existing definition and <a href="#Adding">create a completely new map definition</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>Attribute names in the database are all stored in lower case.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<h4>Generation of Edit Area Changes</h4>
<h5>
Name Changes</h5>
<p>
The format of the line is identical to that found in Maps.py.
Simply repeat the line you want to change and then put in the new editAreaName definition.
For example if you want the edit areas to be named using the contents of the 'cwa' attribute
of the database record you would add the following line ot localMaps.py:
<pre>
CWAzones.editAreaName = 'cwa'
</pre>
</p>
<p>
For detailed examples of editAreaName configuration refer to <a href="mapConfig.html">Maps.py</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> if the generated edit area names are not unique undesirable results may occur.
</p>
<h5>
Group Name for the Edit Areas</h5>
<p>
To have the generated edit areas included in an edit area group simply supply the group name as a string.<br>
<pre>CWAzones.groupName = 'MyZones'</pre>
</p>
<p>
If you don't want the edit areas to be included in a group supply an empty string:
<pre>CWAzones.groupName = ''</pre>
</p>

<h2><a name="Placement"></a>Placement of the localMaps.py file</h2>
The localMaps.py file should always be placed in the /awips2/edex/data/utility/edex_static/site/OAX/config/gfe/
directory on dx3/dx4
as explained <a href="serverConfiguration.html#LocationofFiles">here</a>.
<p>
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<h2><a name="Updating"></a>Updating Map Shapefiles</h2>
Map shape file updates must be imported into the maps database using the importShapeFile.sh script on dx1.
Refer to section <a href="MapFiles.html">Map Files - Map Background Shapefile Handling</a><br>
