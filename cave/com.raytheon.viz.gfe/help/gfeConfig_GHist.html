Grid Manager Grid Data History Configuration</h2>
The grid manager may be toggled into the history mode from the normal
mode.&nbsp;
The history mode will show the origin, source, and modified state of
all
of the grids using a series of colors and patterns.&nbsp; This section
of the gfe configuration file permits tailorability of the display
algorithm.&nbsp;
Generally colors are used to indicate model source or and grid origin
and
patterns are used to indicate that the grid has been modified.
<p>The basic color algorithm is as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the origin of the grid came from a model (e.g., populated),
then the
software looks for a configurable item denoting a color for that
particular
model (with the configuration item format being HistoryModelColor_<i>modelname</i>).&nbsp;
If found, the grid block is painted that color.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
particular
configuration item is not found for the model, then the color specified
in the HistoryOriginColor_Populated is used.</li>
  <li>If the origin of the grid did not come from a model, and hence is
"Calculated",
"Scratch", "Interpolated", or "Other", the color of the grid block is
the
color specified in HistoryOriginColor_<i>origintype</i>.&nbsp; If not
defined,
a gray color is used.</li>
</ul>
The basic pattern algorithm is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>If the grid has not been modified, then no fill pattern is used
and the
grid block is solid.&nbsp; A grid is modified whenever a grid edit
operation
is applied to the grid or if the grid has been time shifted.</li>
  <li>If the grid has been modified by you, then the fill pattern will
be
that
specified by HistoryUserModPattern_Me.&nbsp; <font color="#cc33cc">Note
that a grid is treated as "modified by me" only for the duration of the
current GFE session.&nbsp; Everytime the GFE is started, a new
workstation
identifier is assigned and the grid data history is tracked by
workstation
identifier.</font></li>
  <li>If the grid has been modified by someone else, then the fill
pattern
will
be that specified by HistoryUserModPattern_Other.</li>
</ul>
The text characters algorithm is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>If a grid is modified by me, the text contained in
HistoryUserModText_Me
is used.</li>
  <li>If a grid has been modified by someone else, the text contained
in
HistoryUserModText_Other
is used.</li>
  <li>If a grid has not been modified, and has originated from a model,
then:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>if a model-specific text string is provided, as a configuration
item in
the form of HistoryModelText_<i>modelname</i>, then those will be the
characters
used.</li>
    <li>if a model-specific text string is not provided, then the
configuration
item HistoryOriginText_Populated is used to define the text string.</li>
  </ul>
If a grid has not been modified, and its origin is not a model, then
the
configuration item of the form HistoryOriginText_<i>originType</i> is
used
to define the text string.

The Grid Manager in history mode will indicate by text characters and
patterns
if the grid has been modified.&nbsp; The software can distinguish
between
modified by me, and modified by someone else.&nbsp; Note that the
modified
by me is only indicated for the duration of the current GFE session.
The
available fill patterns are: WHOLE, WIDE, SCATTERED, WIDE_SCATTERED,
ISOLATED,
TRANS_25PC_45DEG, TRANS_25PC_135DEG, SELECTED_AREA, DUALCURVE, CURVE,
VERTICAL,
CROSS, HORIZONTAL, BIGCROSS. You can see <a href="FillPatterns.html">examples
of the fill patterns here</a>.

  <p>The text and color configuration for non-modified grids are
defined
in this section.&nbsp; Grids can have one of five origins: Populated,
Calculated,
Scratch, Interpolated, and Other.&nbsp; Populated grids are those
generated
by ifpInit and generally are copied into the Forecast database.&nbsp;
Calculated
grids are those created from contours. Scratch grids are the grid that
were created from scratch. Interpolated grids are the grids that were
created/modified
from the interpolation technique.&nbsp; Other is a catch-all for all
other
potential sources of grids.&nbsp; Note that the user may also specify
the
specific color and text characters for populated data based on the
modelname
-- see the next section for information on this. </p>
