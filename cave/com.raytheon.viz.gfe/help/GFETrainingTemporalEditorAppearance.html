<h1 align=center>Temporal Editor Appearance</h1>
<hr width="100%">
<p><br>Up to this point you have been using tools in the Grid Manager and
Spatial Editor to edit data spatially. There is, however, a different type
of editor in the GFE, called the Temporal Editor, that edits data temporally.
In the editor, the gridded data is presented data time-series format. This
time-series represents the average value over an area that you define (the
current edit area) as a function of time. An example of the Temporal Editor
display can be found below.</div>

<div CLASS="Body">

Editor.

<p>To get to the Temporal Editor, select the button in the button bar that
looks like the picture at the right. <img SRC="images/toggle1.jpg" ALT="Toggle Grid Manager/Temporal Editor" HSPACE=3>
<p>When you select this button the Grid Manager will disappear and the
Temporal Editor will replace it. To get back to the Grid Manager, just
press the same button again. Note that the button will change in appearance
each time it is selected. If you see no data displays in the Temporal Editor,
use the Select Points tool to define an edit area on the Spatial Editor.
The edit area that you select in the Spatial Editor is sampled and
averaged to produce the time series display.
<p>The weather elements displayed in the Temporal Editor depend upon the
state of weather elements in the Grid Manager, and the <a href="GFEMainMenu.html#TemporalEditorWeatherElementMode">Temporal
Editor Weather Element Mode</a>.
<p>The different type of visualizations are shown <a href="#Visualizations">here</a>.
Several of the visualizations, such as the <a href="#TimeBar">TimeBar</a>,
show the average value as determined from sampling the grid data over the
current edit area. For WEATHER and DISCRETE type of weather
elements, the <a href="#TEColorBar">TEColorBar</a> visualization will show
the various ratios of different weather and discrete values in the sampling
area, as shown below:

<p>Some of the visualizations, such as the RangeBar as shown below, will
show you data distribution information across the edit area.&nbsp; The
user can control the statistics chosen to be displayed, from absolute maximum/minimum,
to moderated values, and to standard deviation values.

Dialog</a>, available from the GFE->Viewing Preferences->Temporal Editor
Statistics Mode menu, controls the type of statistics that are presented:
