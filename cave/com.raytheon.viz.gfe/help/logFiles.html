<h2><a name="location"></a>Location of LogFiles</h2>
In AWIPS2 logfiles are stored in a number of locations for different operations.
EDEX logs are stored in /awips2/edex/logs on dx3/dx4; GFE utilities logs are in 
/awips2/GFESuite/logs/SITE_ID on dx3/dx4; text formatter logs are in 
~/caveData/etc/user/USER_ID/gfe/logs; CAVE logs are in ~/caveData/logs; AlertViz
logs are in ~/caveData/textLogs. All caveData logs are on the local workstation
where GFE is run.
<p>EDEX logs can be configured by modifying the log4j files under /awips2/edex/conf. See 
<a href="https://onestop.noaa3a.awips.noaa.gov/AWIPS_2_Documentation/ssdd/SSDD_Initial_Draft.htm">Software 
System Design Description (SSDD)</a> for implementation details.</p>

<h2><a name="logPref"></a>Logging Preferences</h2>
Logging preferences for EDEX can be changed by modifying the log4j.xml and log4j-ingest.xml
files for the setting "level value". Acceptable settings are TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR,
and FATAL. TRACE is lowest level and FATAL is highest level. A logger set to log at a 
certain level will log that level and all higher levels.  Example: logger set to WARN level 
will log all WARN, ERROR, and FATAL messages, but not TRACE, DEBUG, or INFO levels. 
EDEX must be restarted after any changes to the logging configuration.
