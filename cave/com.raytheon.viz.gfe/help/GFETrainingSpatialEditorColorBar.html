<p>The Color Bar is location at the top of the
Spatial
Editor display. It displays the relationship between the color of
the currently displayed image and the weather element value just like
the
D2D system. In addition, it has a tool that allows you to set the
current Pickup value. This value is used for edit operations such
as Assign Value and Add New Contour. Any click or drag operation
with either MB1 or MB2 causes the Pickup value to change to the value
under
the cursor. This value is displayed on the Color Bar in large
white
numbers with a black background. Try clicking or dragging on the
Color Bar with MB1 or MB2 and watch the Pickup value change.
<p>Several other Color Bar options are available via MB3 pop-up menu
over
the Color Bar. Examples of these options are setting the pickup
value,
delta value, fitting the color bar spectrum to the data, and changing
the
color table. Refer to the <a
 href="Button3Popups.html#SpatialEditorColorBarPopupMenu">Popup
Menu Reference Guide</a> for further details.
