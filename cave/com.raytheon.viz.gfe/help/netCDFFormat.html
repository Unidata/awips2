This document describes the format of the netCDF file that is:

  <li>
read by the <a href="iscMosaic.html">iscMosaic program</a></li>

In AWIPS1 ifpServer read netCDF files for gridded data.  In AWIPS2 this format
has been replaced with <a href="edexHDF5.html">HDF5 format</a>.

Data in the netCDF file</h2>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">To fully understand this
section
you should know something about how netCDF files are structured in
general.&nbsp;
See the netCDF web site at:</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Each of the supported data types
(SCALAR,
VECTOR, and WEATHER) are stored in a slightly different way.&nbsp; All
of the data types are stored as a cube as</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">illustrated by the figure below:</div>
<img src="images/ifpnetCDF1.gif" name="Graphic1" border="0" height="183"
 width="285">
<br>
&nbsp;
<p>For weather elements of type SCALAR, all of the data are stored in
this
simple cube form.&nbsp; For VECTOR weather elements,&nbsp; two cubes
are
used, one for the magnitude, one for direction and they are coordinated
so that the first magnitude grid corresponds to the first direction
grid,
and so on.&nbsp; For WEATHER, one cube is used to store byte values
that map into another structure that holds strings that represent the
weather
values.&nbsp; The following illustration shows how this WEATHER grid
and WEATHER KEY should be used to extract a weather value.
</p>
<p><img src="images/ifpnetCDF2.gif" name="Graphic2" border="0"
 height="167" width="429"></p>
<p>The grid on the left illustrates the values of the byte values for
the
weather grid.&nbsp; The list on the left shows the actual weather
values
expressed
as a text string.&nbsp; In order to determine what the weather value
is at any given point, you will need both the weather byte grid and the
"weather
key".&nbsp; Simply read the byte value in the grid and lookup that
value in the key list.

<br>
<h3><a name="ValidTimes"></a>VaildTimes</h3>
The valid times listed for a weather element define the start time and
end time for each grid in terms of seconds since 01 Jan 1970.&nbsp;
This
is a
standard format for representing time on UNIX systems.&nbsp; The times
listed are organized in pairs.&nbsp; The first pair applies to the
start
time and
end time of the first grid.&nbsp; The second pair applies to the start
time and end time of the second grid, and so on.&nbsp; There should be
exacty the
same number of validTime pairs.
<h3><a name="DescriptiveName"></a>Descriptive Name</h3>
The descriptive name field provides a more detailed description of the
parameter.
<br>
<h3><a name="GridSize"></a>GridSize</h3>
The size of the grid in terms of grid cells expressed as a pair of
numbers
(x, y)
<h3><a name="DomainOrigin"></a>DomainOrigin</h3>
The (x, y) coordinate origin or lower-left corner of the grid domain in
AWIPS coordinates.&nbsp; The AWIPS coordinates are expressed in terms
of
the
current projection (usually the AWIPS 211 projection).
<h3><a name="DomainExtent"></a>DomainExtent</h3>
The (x, y) coordinate of the extent of the office domin expressed in
the
same coordinate system as the origin.&nbsp; This is always the offset
from
the
origin.&nbsp; Adding this coordinate to the origin give the upper-right
coordinate.
<h3><a name="MinMaxAllowedValues"></a>MinMaxAllowedValues</h3>
The minimum and maximum value allowed for this weather element
expressed
as a pair of numbers (min, max).
<h3><a name="GridType"></a>GridType</h3>
The data type for the grids.&nbsp; Possible values are SCALAR, VECTOR,
and WEATHER.
<h3><a name="DatabaseID"></a>DatabaseID</h3>
The database identifier from which the grid originated. It has the
format
CCC_GRID__Fcst_YYYYMMDD_HHMM where,
CCC is the site identifier, YYYY is the year, MM is the number of the
month, DD is the day, HH is the hour and MM is the minute
<h3><a name="SiteID"></a>SiteID</h3>
The three letter identifier of the site from which the data originated.
<h3><a name="Units"></a>Units</h3>
The parameter units field indicates the units used by the data.
<br>
<h3><a name="Level"></a>Level</h3>
The level for this weather element (e.g., 500MB).&nbsp; All surface
data
have the level SFC.
<h3><a name="Precision"></a>Precision</h3>
The number of significant decimal points for the data. A value of 0
indicates
that integer values are all that is important (even if there is more
precision
indicated by the data). A value of 1 indicates that the precision is 10
-1 or 0.1.
<h3><a name="TimeConstraints"></a>Time Constraints</h3>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">The time constraints consist of three
elements: starting time, duration, and repeat interval. These values
indicate
the time limits that the parameter must obey. All grids for the
parameter
must be aligned on the specified time constraints. The starting time
indicates
the time of the first possible grid after 0000z. The duration indicates
the length of the grid. The repeat interval defines how often the grid
can repeat. All of the units are in seconds.
For example, the illustration below
shows
the possible grid boundaries for a time constraint of starting time of
0, duration of 6 hours, and repeat interval of 6 hours:</div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;"><img src="images/ifpAG-5.gif"
 name="Graphic3" border="0" height="118" width="487"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom: 0in;">In the above example, grids can be a
minimum of 6 hours long, but could be 12 or 18 or even 24 hours in
length
just as long as the starting and ending time of the grid falls on one
of
the defined above.
A time constraint can be defined to have gaps in the data. For example,
a 24-hour summary of daytime maximum temperature may have a constraint
of starting time 900z, duration of 18 hours, and a repeat interval of
24
hours:
<p><img src="images/ifpAG-6.gif" name="Graphic4" border="0" height="118"
 width="487"></p>
<p>Most parameters are defined in the database with a one hour
constraint
(start time = 0000z, repeat = 1 hour, duration = 1h). Therefore the
highest
temporal resolution of the grids is one hour:
</p>
<p><img src="images/ifpAG-7.gif" name="Graphic5" border="0" height="118"
 width="487"></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0in;">A special case exists which defines no
constraints. This is the situation with a start time, repeat, and
duration
values all set to 0. The temporal resolution of the grids can be one
second.</div>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<h3><a name="dataMultiplier"></a>Data Multiplier and Data Offset</h3>
The data multiplier and data offset fields are only present when the -k
krunch switch is provided to ifpnetCDF.&nbsp; This forces the data to
be
represented in few bits, if possible.&nbsp; The 32-bit floats may be
converted
to 16-bit or 8-bit integers.&nbsp; If converted, the netCDF attributes
dataMultiplier and dataOffset will be available.&nbsp; The formula to
convert
the netCDF data values into real values is:
<center>
<p>data value = (netCDF value * dataMultiplier) + dataOffset</p>
</center>
<h3>
<a name="ProjectionInfo"></a>Projection Info</h3>
A series of values that allows one to
precisely reconstruct the projection and thus remap the data to any
other
projection.&nbsp; These 12 values comprise all of the value required
to reconstruct any valid AWIPS projection.&nbsp; Note that some are not
used by all projection types. The attributes are latLonLL, latLonUR,
gridPointLL,
gridPointUR, projectionType, latLonOrigin, stdParallelOne,
stdParallelTwo,
lonOrigin, lonCenter.
<br>
<br>
The grid represented in the netCDF file is usually smaller than the
projection information indicates.&nbsp;&nbsp; The projection
information, along with the <a href="#GridSize">Grid Size</a>, <a
 href="#DomainOrigin">Domain Origin</a>, and <a href="#DomainExtent">Domain
Extent</a> information is used to define the location of the sub-grid
on the Earth's surface.<br>
