Color Chooser and Color Table Editor Dialogs</h1>
The <a href="#ColorChooser">color chooser</a> and <a
 href="#ColorTableEditor">color
table editor</a> dialogs are used to define custom colors and color
tables
for the GFE.
<p></p>
<hr width="100%">
<h2><a name="ColorDialog"></a><a name="ColorChooser"></a>Color Chooser
Dialog</h2>
<p><br>
The Color Chooser Dialog is invoked from the GFE when you depress
MB3 over the graphic contour label in the spatial editor.
When
you MB3 graphic contour label, select the following sequence from
the pop-up menus: 'Change Color' -&gt; 'Choose Color'.<b><font
 size="+1"></font></b>

</center>
<p><br>
The Color Chooser Dialog can be used to change a single-colored
graphical feature (i.e., a contour).
</p>
<p>The Color Chooser Dialog consists of Hue, Saturation and Value (same as Brightness)
entry fields, a color wheel, a color swatch to indicate the old or
current color (bottom left corner), a color swatch to reflect the selected color, an "OK" button
and a "Cancel" button. The old color swatch (left) indicates the current
contour color until the 'OK' or 'Cancel' button is selected.</p>  
</p>
<p>If you MB1 over the color wheel to the desired color, the circle
marker
is updated to the cursor location. The selected color is echoed
in
the 'NEW' color swatch and the Hue, Saturation and Brightness sliders
move
to the appropriate values corresponding to your selected color.</p>
<p>For advanced users, in A2,
an option to select color values numerically is also available as entry fields to the right
of the Hue/Saturation/Value entry fields and Color Name entry field that accepts color
names in hex.  Also new in A2, the user now has the option of 
selecting the general color family from the Palette row of colors along the bottom of the 
dialog display. Lastly, the pipette icon allows the user to set the color by sampling it from
anywhere on the screen.</p>
<p>If you want to change your graphical-feature, a.k.a. contour, to the new
color,
select the 'OK' button. Otherwise the 'Cancel' button dismisses
the
Color Chooser without change to your graphical contour.
</p>
<p>A new color can also be selected using the Hue, Saturation or
Value entry fields.
</p>
<p>The various components of the ColorChooser are shown in the
following
table:

<h2><a name="ColorTableEditorDialog"></a><a name="ColorTableEditor"></a>ColorTableEditorDialog</h2>
The ColorTableEditor Dialog is invoked from the GFE when you MB3 over 
the color bar spectrum. Select the following sequence from the
pop-up
menus: 'Change Color Table to'-&gt;'Edit Color
Table'. The dialog
can also be opened by clicking MB3 on the contour map of an element
and selecting Edit Colors...
<p>The ColorTableEditor is used for Scalar and Vector data types.
There is no editor currently available for the Weather data type; the
Weather
data type is configured through the <a href="gfeConfig_WECol.html">gfe
configuration file weather color table definitions</a>. The
ColorTableEditor
for Discrete data types use the same data source as Scalar/Vector, but
its operations are different. Generally it is a good idea to
separate
out color tables for Scalar and Vector, from color tables for Discrete.
<br>
</p>
<h3>Scalar/Vector Color Table Editing</h3>

<h1><img src="images/ColorTableEditor.jpg"></h1>
</center>
The Color Table Editor Dialog can be used to create a new color
spectrum
for a multi-colored graphical feature (i.e., an image).
<p>The Color Table Editor contains a <a href="#ColorChooser">Color
Chooser</a>
(without the old color swatch area). A color spectrum
appears
in the middle section of the dialog. The left and right
triangular
pointers are labeled with minimum and maximum numerical values
corresponding
to the weather product. The '&gt;&gt;' and '&lt;&lt;' buttons enable
the user
to move the pointers in an increment defined by the two entry
fields.
The top row of the dialog allows the user to select RGB or HSB color model.
The bottom half of the dialog contains several buttons that control the
operations performed on the spectrum: 'Interpolate', 'Undo',
'Revert', 'Save...', 'Delete...' and 'Office Save As' buttons.
The 'Fill' and 'Set' buttons appear to the right of the top and bottom
spectrum selection areas. Please note in AWIPS2 any changes are applied
automatically.  The user has to exit and re-enter GFE should they accidentally
exit the color chooser without reverting. 
</p>
<p>After a color is selected using MB1 (i.e., MB1 somewhere within the
spectrum) or the <a href="#ColorChooser">Color Chooser</a>,
it is reflected in the rectangular color swatch. To modify
the spectrum with the selected color, MB1 over either the left or
right pointer. The triangular area will assume the color of the
color
swatch. With the MB1, the left or right pointer can be moved to
the
desired weather product value.

  <p>3. Select a color using the <a href="#ColorChooser">Color
Chooser</a>
portion of the Color Table Editor.</p>
  <p>4. MB1 over the left pointer and move the pointer to
50
degrees Fahrenheit. The left triangular pointer will assume the
color
of the selected color and the color swatch will assume the new color. </p>
  <p>5. Slide the top arrow to 40 degree F location of the
spectrum.</p>
  <p>6. MB1 over the right pointer and move the pointer to
50
degrees Fahrenheit. The right pointer will now assume the color
of
the color swatch. </p>
  <p>7. Select the '&gt;' button. The left and right
pointers will
advance 1 degree F to the right. </p>
  <p>8. Select the '&lt;' button. The right and left
pointers
will decrease 1 degree F to the left. </p>
  <p>9. MB1 over the desired color on the spectrum. The
color
chosen will be reflected in the color swatch. </p>
  <p>10. MB1 on the right pointer. The right pointer will
now
assume the color in the color swatch.</p>
</blockquote>
After completing Exercise 1, you can modify
the
selected portion of the spectrum (eq., area between 40 and 90 degrees
Fahrenheit)
with the buttons located on the top half, bottom half, and right of the dialog: 'Fill',
'Set', 'Interpolate',
'Undo', 'Revert', 'Save...', 'Delete...' or 'Office Save As...'.
<p>The various controls are described in the following table:
<br>

      <td><b>Control</b></td>
      <td><b>Description</b></td>

      <td>The 'Fill' button, will fill the selected portion of the
spectrum.</td>
    </tr>

      <td>Set</td>
      <td>The 'Set' button, will set the selected value of the
spectrum.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Interpolate</td>
      <td>You can linearly interpolate the area selected between the
pointers
with one of two linear interpolation methods: Red-Green-Blue
interpolation
(i.e., 'RGB Interpolation' button) or Hue-Saturation-Brightness
interpolation
(i.e., 'HSB Interpolation' button).
      <p>The HSB interpolation will 'linearly' interpolate along the
shortest
angle of the color wheel indicated by the colors of the pointers.
The RGB interpolation will linearly interpolate along the 0-255
color
intensity scale of red, green and blue between the colors of the
pointers.</p>

<h3>
Discrete Color Table Editing</h3>
<p><br>
</p>

<p><a name="Figure2aColorTableEditorDialogDiscrete"></a><b><font

Dialog (Discrete)</font></b></p>
</center>
<center>
<h1><img src="images/DialogColorTableDiscrete.jpg" nosave="" title=""
 alt="DialogDiscreteColorTable"></h1>
</center>
The Discrete Color Table Editor Dialog can be used to create a new
color
spectrum for a multi-colored graphical feature (i.e., an image).
<p>The Discrete ColorTable Editor contains a <a href="#ColorChooser">Color
Chooser</a> (without the old color swatch area).
A color spectrum appears in the middle section of the dialog. The
text label contains the selected weather product name and units.
In AWIPS2 all of the buttons on the Color Table Editor for Scalar/Vector are
available on the Discrete Color Table Editor.
</p>
<p>After a color is selected using MB1 click (i.e., MB1 somewhere
within
the spectrum) or the <a href="#ColorChooser">Color Chooser</a>,
it is reflected in the rectangular color swatch. To modify
the spectrum with the selected color, MB1 click over the desired
discrete key. When you move the mouse over a "block" in the spectrum,
the value of that "block", i.e., the discrete key, will be
displayed.<br>
</p>
<p>Note that Discrete color tables and Scalar color tables should not
be shared. Discrete color tables that are saved to EDEX
contain exactly the same number of entries as the possible entries in
the defined Discrete key. For example, if a KeyTest element
contains exactly 3 colors and you reuse that color
spectrum for a scalar/vector weather element, then there will only be
three colors in that color table.<br>
</p>
<p>If a discrete color table has
been saved to disk, then the definition for the discrete weather
element is expanded, then the new entries will be assigned to "black"
until the color table editor is used to define these colors. The
original colors for the original set of discrete keys will remain
assigned.<br>
