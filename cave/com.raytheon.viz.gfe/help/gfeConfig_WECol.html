Weather Color Algorithm Configuration</h2>
The weather color algorithm is very complicated.&nbsp; In order to
understand
the algorithm, it is important to understand the capability of the
weather
key and its components: coverage/probability, type, intensity,
visibility,
and optional attributes.
<p>The allowed names of types, intensities, and coverage/probabilities
are available in the <a
 href="serverConfig.html#WeatherConfigurationSection"><!--disable indexer-->serverConfig.py</a>
file.</p>

Color
Algorithm</font>
</h3>
The current weather color algorithm ignores visibility and optional
attributes.&nbsp;
The following table illustrates the color algorithm. A composite
weather
type is defined as more than one weather type combined for one
coverage/probability.&nbsp;
For example, rain is a weather type and snow is a weather type.
Combining
rain and snow would be considered a composite weather type.

<h4>
<a name="WeatherCoverageFillPatterns"></a><font size="+1">Weather
Coverage
Fill Patterns</font></h4>
WeatherCoverage_names and WeatherCoverage_fillPatterns are
parallel lists of values and must be the same size.&nbsp; For each
possible
weather coverage, the fill patterns array defines the fill pattern to
use.&nbsp;
There are only a few allowed fill patterns and line patterns that may
be
used. If additional patterns are designed, you will need to contact the
developers. The available fill patterns are:
<blockquote><li>WHOLE</li>
  <li>WIDE</li>
  <li>SCATTERED</li>
  <li>WIDE_SCATTERED</li>
  <li>ISOLATED</li>
  <li>TRANS_25PC_45DEG</li>
  <li>TRANS_25PC_135DEG</li>
  <li>SELECTED_AREA</li>
  <li>DUALCURVE</li>
  <li>CURVE</li>
  <li>VERTICAL</li>
  <li>CROSS</li>
  <li>HORIZONTAL</li>
</blockquote>
You can view <a href="FillPatterns.html">examples of these fill
patterns
here</a>.
<p>For example, if "Iso" coverage is in the 1st entry of the list and
ISOLATED
appears in the first entry of the fill patterns, the for Iso coverage,
the fill pattern ISOLATED will be used.

With the set of WeatherType and WeatherTypeInten lists, the user may
specify
different color combinations for different weather types.&nbsp; An
example
of this is shown in the following table:
<table nosave="" border="1" cols="2" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>

    <tr>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>No weather</td>
      <td>Gray40</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

The entries in the two lists would be as follows:
<p><b><tt>WeatherType_names = ["S", "R", "F", "RS", "ZR", "TRW",
"&lt;NoWx&gt;"]</tt></b>
<br>

<br>
<b><tt>WeatherTypeInten_colors = ["red1", "cyan"]</tt></b>
</p>
<p><tt>T</tt>he weather type entries are parallel lists of values and
must
be the same size.&nbsp; The user defines the color desired for a
particular
composite weather type.&nbsp; The color names may be X colors either in
named color or #rrggbb format. This list does not contain intensity
descriptors
and is searched after the WeatherTypeInten_names and
WeatherTypeInten_colors.
</p>
<p>The weather type intensity entries are parallel lists of values and
must be the same size. The user defines the color desired for a
particular
composite weather type and intensity.

<h4><a name="WeatherGenericColros"></a><font size="+1">Weather Generic
Colors</font></h4>
Weather Generic colors are used for any types that are not defined in
the
WeatherType_names or WeatherTypeInten_names.&nbsp; The set of generic
colors
are also used for complex weather patterns, where 3 or more different
probabilities/coverages
are present in a grid cell.&nbsp; The colors in this list will be used
before a "random" color is chosen.
