#Example file for adding a new model.  There are other steps that are
#necessary to make this work, such as adding new databases to your localConfig
#and setting up the init stream to recognize this file.  Refer to the 
#SmartInit documentation for details.

#This example will extract the WaveHeight and Wind information out of the
#GWW model and make an IFP database with that information.
