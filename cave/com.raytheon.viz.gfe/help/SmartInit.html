<h2><a name="HowSmartInitializationWorks"></a>How Smart Initialization
Works</h2>
Smart initialization is closely coupled with EDEX. EDEX
is aware of D2D model data changes and therefore knows when IFP data
grids
can be created. Whenever EDEX first starts, or new D2D
model
data is detected (which occurs frequently - less than 5 minute
intervals), the server will
examine
the serverConfig/localConfig configuration file for the INITMODULES
definition.
If it finds a match with the updated D2D model, then it will spawn a
process
to run smart initialization for that model.
<p>When a smart initialization process is started, it will run a
particular
class file, either one that has been supplied with the release, or one
you have added. The software will examine all of the functions
within
that class looking for function names that begin with calc***.
These
functions define the output weather element, e.g., calcT will derive T,
and also the dependencies. The dependencies are determined from
the
argument list for each function.
</p>
<p>The smart initialization software then figures out the dependencies
for all of the calc*** functions and will determine what must run
first,
second, third, etc. This is done automatically and the programmer
need not be concerned about it. The software also examines the
inventory
for the dependent grids and the inventory for the output grids to
determine
if the output grid is already present and no calculations are needed,
or
whether the output grid needs to be created by running the algorithms.
</p>
<p>When all the possible dependencies and algorithms have run, the
process
exits until the next D2D model update.
</p>
<p>Smart Initialization algorithms are written in a simple, intuitive
language
called Python and its extension, numpy. The following
sections
assume that you have knowledge of Python which is covered in the
<a href="Python.html">GFESuite
Python Tutorial and Programming Guidelines</a>.
<br>
</p>
<hr width="100%">
<h2><a name="Wherearethefiles"></a>Where are the files that control
smart initialization?</h2>
The standard smart initialization files that are supplied with the
release
are installed into your <i>release</i>/edex/data/utility/edex_static/base/smartinit 
directory. No modifications
should be made to any of the files in the BASE directory.
User-customized
files are installed into the <i>release</i>/edex/data/utility/edex_static/site/SITE/smartinit 
directory. These SITE files are not overwritten during installs and upgrades.
<br>
<hr width="100%">
<h2><a name="BasicFileStructure"></a>Basic File Structure</h2>
The basic structure of a smart initialization file contains a header
that is simliar to:
<p><tt>from Init import *</tt>
</p>
<p><tt>class <i>model</i>Forecaster(<i>derivedFrom</i>Forecaster):</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def __init__(self):</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>derivedFrom</i>Forecaster.__init__(self,
"<i>sourceDb</i>", "<i>destDb</i>")</tt>
</p>
<p>This is basically defining a new class called "<i>model</i>Forecaster",
which is derived from "<i>derivedFrom</i>Forecaster". The
__init__
function is the constructor to the class, which calls the base class
(class
it has been defined from) with three arguments, self, "sourceDb",
and "destDb". The source db is the name of the D2D database, such
as NAM80, NAM40, NAM12, NGM80, RUC80, GFS40, gfsLR. The
destination database is the name of the output
database, such as NAM12, GFS40, NAM_V. If there is an underscore
in the destination database, then the format is the
modelname_optionaltype.
</p>
<p>A complete example of the header is shown below:
</p>
<p><tt>from Init import *</tt>
</p>
<p><tt>class NAM12Forecaster(Forecaster):</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def __init__(self):</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Forecaster.__init__(self,
"NAM12", "NAM12")</tt>
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>There usually is a function called levels() which define a set of
vertical
pressure levels which are used when accessing cube data from the
models.
The levels() return a list of level values to use. Make sure that
the levels you specify are actually available in the model. A complete
example is shown below:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; def levels(self):</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return ["MB950",
"MB900","MB850","MB800","MB750",</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"MB700","MB650","MB600","MB550", "MB500",</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
"MB450", "MB400", "MB350"]</tt>
</p>
<p>Following the levels() function are the set of functions with a
particular
name. The calculation functions <b><font color="#000099">MUST
ALL
BEGIN WITH calc</font></b> in their name. That is how smart
initialization
can determine what to run. It basically runs all calc***
functions
that are defined. The remainder of the name of the function after
"calc" is the parameter name to create. For example, if RH is
your
weather element name, the name of the function to calculate RH would be
calcRH(). The typical format for a calc function is shown below, this
one
calculates surface temperature from the eta model:
</p>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def calcT(self, t_FHAG2, t_BL3060, p_SFC,
stopo,
topo):</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dpdz = 287.04 * t_FHAG2
/ (p_SFC / 100 * 9.8) # meters / millibar</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # 45milibars is halfway
between 30 and 60</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dpdz = dpdz * 45 #
meters
between p_SFC and t_BL3060</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lapse = (t_FHAG2 -
t_BL3060)
/ dpdz # degrees / meter</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lapse = clip(lapse,
lapse, 0.012)</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t = t_FHAG2 + lapse
* (stopo - topo)</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return self.KtoF(t)</tt>
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Here is the same function with more details:
</p>
<p>The following grids from the D2D model database are passed into this
routine, 2 meter temperatures, the boundary layer temperatures from the
30-60 hPa levels, the surface pressure in Pascals, surface topography
from
the model, and the high resolution topographical data.
</p>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def calcT(self, t_FHAG2, t_BL3060, p_SFC,
stopo,
topo):</tt>
</p>
<p>We begin to calculate the lapse rate, but first we need to determine
the number of meters between the surface and 30-60 hPa level.
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dpdz = 287.04 * t_FHAG2
/ (p_SFC / 100 * 9.8) # meters / millibar</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # 45milibars is halfway
between 30 and 60</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dpdz = dpdz * 45 #
meters
between p_SFC and t_BL3060</tt>
</p>
<p>The lapse rate can now be calculated:
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lapse = (t_FHAG2 -
t_BL3060)
/ dpdz # degrees / meter</tt>
</p>
<p>We ensure that the lapse rate can't get too steep
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lapse = clip(lapse,
lapse, 0.012)</tt>
</p>
<p>We calculate the surface temperature, which is the model 2m
temperature
modified by the lapse rate and the difference between the model surface
and the real surface elevation.
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; t = t_FHAG2 + lapse
* (stopo - topo)</tt>
</p>
<p>We perform unit conversion and return.
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return self.KtoF(t)</tt>
</p>
<p>The name of the function is always calc***&nbsp;where *** is the
weather
element name and level. If you are creating weather elements for
surface data then the weather element name by itself is
sufficient.
If you are creating weather elements for upper air or non-surface data,
then the name of the calc function is:&nbsp;&nbsp;calc***_***, such as
calcWind_3K() for the Wind at 3000 feet.
</p>
<p>Note the argument list for the calc*** functions. The first
argument
is always self. The remainder of the arguments represent gridded
data. The format of the specification can be one of the following
formats:
<br>
<table nosave="" width="100%" border="1">

    <tr>
      <td><b>Format</b></td>
      <td><b>Example</b></td>

      <td>EditAreaName</td>
      <td>Colorado</td>
      <td>The name of an editArea. It is probably best to use polygon
edit areas
instead of queries (untested with queries). The value of the paramater,
in this case Colorado, will be a boolean grid suitable for use as a
mask
for numeric functions.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>parmName_level</td>
      <td>t_FHAG2</td>

    <tr>
      <td>parmName_c</td>
      <td>rh_c</td>
      <td>Refers to a cube of data for the parmName. The "_c" indicates
the cube.
The number of layers in the cube depend upon the levels() function
contents.
For example, if the levels() contain: <br>
      <tt>&nbsp; def levels(self):</tt> <br>
      <tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return ["MB950",
"MB900","MB850","MB800","MB750",</tt> <br>

"MB450", "MB400", "MB350"]</tt> <br>
then the cube will contain 13 levels. Access of individual levels
can be done using indexing within the function.</td>

<p>You can place additional functions (e.g., utility) functions
anywhere
in the file after the constructor (__init__) and before the tail end of
the file. An example of a utility function could be one to
calculate Td from T and RH as shown below:
</p>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp; def getTd(self, t, rh):</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # input/output in
degrees
K.</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desat = clip(t, 0,
373.15)</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desat = where(less(t,
173.15), 3.777647e-05, t)</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desat = exp(26.660820
- desat * 0.0091379024 - 6106.3960 / desat)</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desat = desat * rh /
100.0</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desat = 26.66082 -
log(desat)</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; td = (desat -
sqrt(desat*desat-223.1986))/0.0182758048</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; td = where(greater(td,
t), t, td)</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return td</tt>
</p>
<p>The tail end of the file contains a definition of main() and must be
similar to that below:
</p>
<p><tt>def main():</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>model</i>Forecaster().run()</tt>
</p>
<p>Here is an example of a real tail to the file. The name of the class
within the main() function must match the name of the class you have
defined
in the header:
</p>
<p><tt>def main():</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAM12Forecaster().run()</tt>
</p>
<h2>
<hr width="100%"><a name="Workingwith"></a>Working with SCALAR, VECTOR,
WEATHER, and DISCRETE Data</h2>
This section describes accessing scalar, vector, and weather data
through
numerical python.
<h3>SCALAR</h3>
<p><br>
When passing in a weather element that is scalar, you will either
get a grid, or a cube. The grid is a numeric 2-d grid
(x,y),
the cube is a numeric 3-d grid (z,x,y).
<br>
</p>
<h3>VECTOR</h3>
For a single vector grid (single level), you get a tuple. The
first
element is a grid of magnitude, the second is a grid of
direction.
To access the magnitude grid, use this syntax: <tt>wind_SFC[0]</tt>,
and
for direction, use this syntax: <tt>wind_SFC[1]</tt>. Once
you access either the magnitude or direction grid, they are treated
like
a scalar grid.
<p>There are several "utility" functions in Init.py (located in your
release/edex/data/utility/edex_static/base/smartinit
directory) that can help you when working with vector data. The <tt>self._getUV(
mag, dir)</tt> call will convert a magnitude/direction grids into a
returned
tuple of u and v. The u component is [0] and the v component is
[1].
The <tt>self._getMD(u,v)</tt> function converts a grid in u and v
components
into a tuple of magnitude and direction. The magnitude component
is [0] and the direction component is [1].
<br>
</p>
<h3>WEATHER</h3>
Weather is much more complicated and can be a big performance problem.
A tuple is provided. The first element is a grid, which contains
the indexes into the key. The second element is a sequence of all of
the
keys. The keys are the ugly strings associated with a
WeatherKey.
To access the grid:
<p><tt>Wx[0]</tt>
</p>
<p>To access the sequence, use:
</p>
<p><tt>Wx[1]</tt>
</p>
<p>To access a particular entry in the sequence, use:
</p>
<p><tt>Wx[1][3]</tt>, would give your the 4th key.
</p>
<p>Normally you don't access the weather grid in your calculations, but
if you need to, you have generally created a weather grid first.
In smart initialization, we know all of the possible weather keys that
can be created and set up a table with those keys, then we simply poke
in the correct index for the key. This is much more efficient
than
searching the keys for each grid point.
<br>
</p>
<h3>DICRETE</h3>
Discrete is much more complicated than the simple scalar and vector
case,
and like weather, can be a big performance problem. A tuple is
provided.
The first element is a grid, which contains the indexes into the key.
The
second element is a sequence of all of the keys. The keys
are
the discrete key values associated with the weather element. To
access
the grid:
<p><tt>DK[0]</tt>
</p>
<p>To access the sequence, use:
</p>
<p><tt>DK[1]</tt>
</p>
<p>To access a particular entry in the sequence, use:
</p>
<p><tt>DK[1][3]</tt>, would give your the 4th key.
</p>
<p>Normally you don't access the discrete grid in your calculations,
but
if you need to, you have generally created a discrete grid first.
In smart initialization, we know all of the possible discrete keys that
can be created and set up a table with those keys, then we simply poke
in the correct index for the key. This is much more efficient
than
searching the keys for each grid point.

<h2>
<a name="ModifyinganExistingAlgorithm"></a>Modifying an Existing
Algorithm</h2>
The basic procedure to modify an existing algorithm is shown below:
<ul>
  <li>Create a new file in <i>release</i> which should be
named
similarily,
but not identical to, the class in which you are modifying. For
example,
if you are modifying the NAM12 model intiialization, which is stored in
NAM12.py,
perhaps you should name your new file MyNAM12.py to indicate that this
is
your eta.</li>
  <li>The format of the file should be standard as shown in the <a
 href="#BasicFileStructure">Basic
File Structure section</a> above. In particular, it needs
to
include the following items:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>the header, which is set to inherit the file you are inheriting
from</li>
    <li>the levels() function, but only if you are changing it</li>
    <li>a replacement, named the same, of the function you are
modifying.
You may want to copy this function (not ALL functions -- just this one)
into this file from the original file and then edit it.</li>
    <li>the tail, which includes the main() and the final if __name__
statements</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Modify (create first if necessary) your server <a
 href="localConfig.html#InitializationModules">localConfig.py
file to override the INITMODULES</a> section of the serverConfig.py.</li>
</ul>
Here is an example of overriding the NAM12 derivation of Snow
Amount.
The original NAM12.py file contains the following information (only
part
of the file is shown). The snow amount function calculates the
snow
ratio which varies depending upon temperature, and then assigns the
snow
amount based on the snow ratio and QPF where the snow level (freezing
level
- 1000

</p>
<p><tt>def main():</tt>

<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NAM12Forecaster().run()</tt>
</p>
<p>Here is the derived MyNAM12 file that overrides the calcSnowAmt()
function:
</p>
<p><tt>from NAM12 import *</tt>
</p>
<p>c<tt>lass MyNAM12Forecaster(NAM12Forecaster):</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def __init__(self):</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
NAM12Forecaster.__init__(self)</tt>
</p>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def calcSnowAmt(self, T, QPF):</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; m2 = less_equal(T, 32)</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snowamt = where(m2,
10.0 * QPF, 0)</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return snowamt</tt>
</p>
<p><tt>def main():</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MyNAM12Forecaster().run()</tt>
</p>
<p>The algorithm was changed to have a fixed 10:1 snow ratio anytime
the
temperature is below 32. The freezing level is no longer used in
this revision. Of course you can completely rewrite the
algorithm,
use different arguments, etc. Note that the name of the function,
calcSnowAmt() in this case is identical to to the name in the original
file. This is important!

Here is an example of a MyNAM12.py initialization file that creates a
new
weather element called RH for the NAM model.&nbsp; It does nothing more
than taking the model RH FHAG2 field and storing it into the NAM12 RH
weather
element, after ensuring that the field ranges between 0 and 100%:
<p><tt>from NAM12 import *</tt>

<p><tt>class MyNAM12Forecaster(NAM12Forecaster):</tt>

<h2><a name="AddingNewModels"></a>Adding New Models</h2>
Adding new models, and all of the algorithms to derive the elements
isn't
much different from <a href="#AddingNewAlgorithms">Adding New
Algorithms</a>
or <a href="#ModifyinganExistingAlgorithm">Modifying an Existing
Algorithm</a>.
The basic steps are:
<ul>
  <li>Create a new file in <i>release</i>/edex/data/utility/edex_static/site/SITE/smartinit 
  which should be named appropriately
(and not the same name as any file in <i>release</i>/edex/data/utility/edex_static/base/
smartnit) For
example,
if you are going to create a GWW model initialization, then the name
should
probably be GWW.py.</li>
  <li>The format of the file should be standard as shown in the <a
 href="#BasicFileStructure">Basic
File Structure section</a> above. In particular, it needs
to
include the following items:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>the header, which is set to inherit the file you are
interheiting from</li>
    <li>the levels() function, which you don't need if you aren't
accessing any
D2D-cube data.</li>
    <li>all of the calc*** functions that are required to create each
of your
weather
elements.</li>
    <li>the tail, which includes the main() statement</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Modify (create first if necessary) your server <a
 href="localConfig.html#InitializationModules">localConfig.py
file to override the INITMODULES</a> section of the serverConfig.py.</li>
  <li>Modify (create first if necessary) you server <a
 href="localConfig.html#AddinganewDatabase">localConfig.py
file to define a new database</a> and all of the weather elements
associated
with the database.</li>
</ul>
Here is a complete example of creating WaveHeight and Surface Wind from
the GWW model. The wave height logic catches values that
are very high and assumes that they are missing data and resets them to
zero height. There is also a conversion from meters to
feet.
The wind logic also catches values that are very high and assumes that
they are missing data and resets the winds to calm. There is also
a conversion from meters/second to knots.:
<p><tt>from Init import *</tt>
<br>
<tt>class GWWForecaster(Forecaster):</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def __init__(self):</tt>
<br>

Forecaster.__init__(self,
"GWW", "GWW")</tt>
</p>
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def calcWaveHeight(self, htsgw_SFC):</tt>
<br>
<tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grid =

<h2><a name="CommandLine"></a>Running Smart Initialization from the
Command
Line</h2>
Normally you don't need to run smart initialization from the command
line.
Smart initialization is automatically started by EDEX when new
D2D model data arrives.
<p>In the event that you do want to run smart initialization from the
command
line, which you probably would when you are developing new algorithms,
here is the proper syntax:
</p>
<p><tt>ifpInit [-h host] [-p port] [-t modelTime] [-s site] [-u userid] [-a]
algorithmFile</tt>
<br>
<br>
<table nosave="" width="100%" border="1">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><b>Switch</b></td>
      <td><b>Optional?</b></td>
      <td><b>Purpose</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-h host</td>
      <td>yes</td>
      <td>Defines the host upon which EDEX is running.
Normally
this switch is not needed and the software will determine where EDEX
is running.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-p port</td>
      <td>yes</td>
      <td>Defines the RPC port upon which EDEX is
running. Normally
this switch is not needed and the software will determine where EDEX
is running.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-t modelTime</td>
      <td>yes</td>
      <td>Specifies the model run time in the format of
yyyymmdd_hhmm.
If not specified, then run using the latest model data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-s site</td>
      <td>no</td>
      <td>Specifies the site id for whom to run the init.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-u user</td>
      <td>yes</td>
      <td>Specifies the user id who is executing the init.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-a</td>
      <td>yes</td>
      <td>Specifies to create all of the possible data grids, which
will overwrite
existing previously calculated grids. Normally by default, only
those
grids that haven't yet been created will be attempted to be calculated.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>algorithmFile</td>
      <td>no</td>
      <td>Mandatory argument specifying the name of the smart
initialization
module, such as NAM12, or MyNAM12.</td>
    </tr>

<font color="#3366ff">Note: The -h and -p switches are predefined to
match your AWIPS installation, such that they will point to EDEX
specified on installation. Thus the -h and -p switches are not
necessary for normal running of this program. However, if you wish to
