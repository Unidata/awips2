Discrete Color Algorithm Configuration</h2>
The discrete color algorithm is very simple in the case of
non-overlapping
discrete configuration.&nbsp; It simply uses a color table in much the
same way as SCALAR and VECTOR use color tables.&nbsp; The algorithm
becomes
more complicated when the discrete element contains overlapping
information.</div>

The Discrete Overlap Pattern entry defines the set of patterns to use
for
overlapping discrete fields where an overlap occurs.&nbsp;&nbsp; The
number
of patterns indicate the number of overlaps that will be made visually
before the Discrete Complex Pattern and Discrete Overlap Pattern is
used.
