In many cases, we would like to increase the temporal resolution reported.  To do so, we can add an optional entry to specify the time period over which we want statistics.  In this example, we are requesting that a vectorAvg be calculated for every 6-hour period within the component time period.  So if our component is 12 hours long, we will get a pair of statistics, one for the first 6 hours and another for the second 6 hours.
