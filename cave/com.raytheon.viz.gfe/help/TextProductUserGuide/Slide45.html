<p><p><big>After the "generateProduct" method, each of the sub-methods appears.  This is the "meat" of the product where its unique format is created.<br><br>Note that the methods and variables in the Standard file are prefixed with an underscore. For example, "_getVariables", "_areaList", etc. It is imperative that all files inheriting from the Text Product infrastructure adhere to this rule to avoid inadvertent name conflicts with the library methods. <br></big>
