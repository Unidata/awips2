As an example, suppose we are sampling MaxT over a given edit area.  The Sampler will give us a list of histogram pairs where each pair tells us the number of points within the edit area with the given value.  In the example, 10 points have a MaxT of 85 degrees, 15 points have a MaxT of 86 degrees, etc.  Next, we analyze the data. In this case, we have requested a “minMax” summary statistic which returns a minimum value of 85 and a maximum value of 93 over the entire edit area.  Finally, we submit these statstics to a Text Rules method which produces wording, “HIGHS 85 to 93”.
