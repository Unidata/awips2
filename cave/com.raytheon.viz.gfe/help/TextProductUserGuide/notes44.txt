Next, we have the “generateProducts” method which conducts the general flow of product execution. It consists of the following methods and steps:
 _getVariables: Get the variables entered by the user from the VariableList definition and set up any product specific variables.
 _getAreaList: Get the list of edit areas over which the product will run.
 _determineTimeRanges: Calculate the time ranges over which we’ll need to sample the data.
 _sampleData: Sample the data
 _preProcessProduct: Create the product header.
 Now we loop through each edit area producing a header (_preProcessArea), the product text (_makeProduct), and a footer (_postProcessArea).
 _postProcessProduct: Create product footer.
 Return the resulting text string.
