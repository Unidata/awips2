<p><p><big>In some products, you will see more than one analysis method listed for a weather element.  It is important to know that the phrase methods are sensitive ONLY to the FIRST one listed.  Additional analysis is performed by the system and is used as a secondary piece of information by the formatter code. For example, the second method shown here (vectorMinMax) is used when reporting wind gusts. DO NOT remove or change the secondary analysis methods as they the system expects them to be there!<br></big>
