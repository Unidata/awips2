<p><p><big>Once you have set up the edit areas for your site, you may want to adjust the entries in the AreaDictionary which is used to generate Area Headers for your product.  From the Utilities Window of the Define Text Products Dialog, find the AreaDictionary and choose MB3-->Modify.  You will see a Python dictionary with entries for the many edit areas, including the generic ones we set up previously.  For each site-specific edit area you set up for your product, make sure the entry in the AreaDictionary is correct.  <br></big>
