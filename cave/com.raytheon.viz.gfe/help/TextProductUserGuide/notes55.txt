It is also useful to override methods from the Standard file or the Text Product Infrastructure.  This means that instead of modifying the read-only files, you copy the code into your Site Overrides file and modify it there. Because of the inheritance hierarchy, the code within your Site Overrides file takes precedence and is executed instead of the original.  To do so, make sure you copy the method within the class definition and preserve the indentation.
