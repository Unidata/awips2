<p><p><big>This set of slides and notes is to be used in conjunction with the Text Product Reference Guide which is referred to throughout for more details and in-depth examples.  <br><br>The GFESuite Text Products are considered Local Applications.  This means that the out-of-the-box core products require customization by most sites to meet local requirements.  In addition to the core products,  the Text Product framework will support the creation of new local products. <br></big>
