Before beginning this section, you should have a running "out-of-the-box" version of your selected text product using customized edit areas specific to your site.  We will call this the "vanilla" version of the product.  At this point, you are ready to further customize the product to your Local site's requirements.  We will first examine the template format used for all smart text products, and then discuss customizations of the Definition section of each Local file.  For Tabular-type products, this will cover most of the customizations you will want to make.  Then we will cover further customization techniques for Narrative-type products. Finally, we will learn how to create Headlines in the text products.
