<p><p><big>The GFESuite supports the creation of text products in both tabular and narrative forms.  The Local Formatters delivered with the release are considered "templates" in that they meet the NWS directives for the standard core products.  You will want to customize them to your local site's requirements.  The wording of the narrative products is not considered to be of extremely high quality, but can be characterized as accurate and "good enough." Also, as they become more widely used, we expect to identify bugs and important enhancements. Since the products are written in Python, these can be easily patched into the existing formatters. The infrastructure upon which these products are built consisted of C++ and Python modules in AWIPS1; Java and Python modules in AWIPS2 and provides the framework upon which new local products can be created.<br></big>
