<p><p><big>We might want the minimum range to vary based on the magnitude of the winds. Any threshold with the "nlValue" suffix can be set as a dictionary of non-linear values.  Each entry specifies a (lowVal, highVal) range such that if the wind magnitude is greater or equal to the first value AND less than the second value, the threshold will be set to the corresponding dictionary value. The special "default" entry will be used if the data value in question does not fall into any of the ranges given.  It is recommended that you always include a "default" entry. <br>It is the responsibility of the code using the non-linear threshold to apply it to the data value. For more examples and a complete description of non-linear thresholds see the Strategy for Non-linear Thresholds section of the Text Product Reference Guide.<br></big>
