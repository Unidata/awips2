This presentation describes the GFESuite Local Formatter Infrastructure and Core Products. An overview is given in the Introduction section.  We describe how to set up the core products and how to make basic customizations to these products to meet the requirements of your local site.  Finally, we will cover how to obtain help and give feedback when setting up the formatters.
Note that there is a section in the Text Products Reference Guide on “Upgrades and Backward Compatibility” to which you can refer if you have text products from prior releases.
