<p><p><big>Here are some suggestions for organizing your Override file into sections that will make trouble-shooting and understanding your Customizations easier.  Put all the code that you are overriding in one section, perhaps labeled by the source of the overridden code e.g. "Overrides from AreaFcst", "Overrides from ConfigVariables", "Overrides from FirePhrases.  Be sure and comment the lines you are changing! Sometimes you might find it useful to override methods and insert print statements to trouble-shoot a problem you might be having.  This is an excellent way to track problems and also learn how the code works.  However, be sure and put this code in a separate section and clear it out after the problem is fixed so that you will not miss upgrades and bug fixes to this code in subsequent releases.<br></big>
