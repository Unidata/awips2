Using information contained in the tree, we can test for the current edit area and return a value based on the result. We use the special helper method, “currentAreaContains”, which checks to see if the current edit area is equal to any of the listed edit areas OR if the current edit area is a Combination which contains ANY of the edit areas listed.  We can then return different  values of for gust_wind_difference for different edit areas.
