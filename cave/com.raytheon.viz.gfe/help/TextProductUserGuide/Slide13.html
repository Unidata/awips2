<p><p><big>Recall the notation for representing classes and their inheritance relationships from the GFESuite Python Tutorial.  The symbol indicates that the Derived Class inherits all the methods and variables from the Base Class. Think of the symbol not as an arrow indicating flow, but as an "umbrella" indicating inclusion of capatilities.  Now we'll look at the Text Products classes and their inheritance relationships. <br></big>
