<p><p><big>Alternatively, you may specify the edit area by giving a (latitude, longitude, dimension) tuple.  The dimension is in kilometers and the the system will create a temporary edit area on-the-fly which is a square of the given dimension with the lat/lon as center.  An example is shown here.
