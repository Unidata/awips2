Some regions are creating Regional product files as a starting point for the local sites.  You could simply have a section in your Local file labeled "Overrides from Region" to isolate these changes and keep them separate from your Local overrides.  Alternatively, you could implement an inheritance scheme as follows: First, comment out all overrides in the Local file.  Then create a Text Utility (Define Text Products Text Utilities window) that has a class e.g. Regional_ZFP, that includes desired overrides.  Finally, you can import and inherit this class into your Local file to enable it's overrides.
