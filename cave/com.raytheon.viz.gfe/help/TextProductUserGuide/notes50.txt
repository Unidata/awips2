The entries in the Definition section can be overridden in the Site Definition file which looks similar to that above. The first line declares our Local product and states that it inherits all the functionality from the Standard file, in this case, the CCF product. The next line makes a copy of the Definition from the Standard file. We can now override Definition entries by changing their value in the Site Definition file as we did previously for the “displayName”.
