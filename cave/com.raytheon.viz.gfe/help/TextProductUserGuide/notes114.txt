For example, “ScalarPhrases” deals with scalar weather elements such as “MaxT”, “MinT’, “PoP”, “SnowAmt”, etc.  “VectorRelatedPhrases” deals with “Wind” and “WindGust”.   Many of the most common thresholds and variables apply to multiple weather elements and are, thus, included in the “ConfigVariables” class.  These are the module names that appear in the Text Reference tables for narrative phrases to help you locate the threshold or variable of interest.
