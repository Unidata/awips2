Here you will see example phrasing, the recommended analysis method(s), and all the thresholds and variables that apply to the phrase.  By changing these thresholds and variables, you can alter the results of the phrase method. Remember to check the Standard file first for any pre-existing overrides,  If not there, the Reference tells which modules to search to find the threshold or variable.  View the module through the Define Text Products Text Utilities window to locate the threshold or variable.  You  can read the documentation there, and if you decide to alter the default, you can copy and paste it into your Overrides file to make the change.
