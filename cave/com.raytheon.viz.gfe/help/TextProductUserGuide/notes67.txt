If you would like to change the default settings, you can copy this dictionary into your Site Overrides file.  However, this particular dictionary is very large and, most likely, you will only want to override one or two entries.  You can use the trick shown in which the method definition and argument list appear as in the original file, but the second line retrieves the entire dictionary. Now you can simply override selected entries and return the altered dictionary.
