There is much more information and examples regarding Local Effects  in the Local Effects section of the TextProduct Reference Guide.
There you can see that any part of the Local Effect definition may be determined “on-the-fly”, perhaps based on the current edit area.  This is possible by specifying any portion of the Local Effect definition as a method which will have the familiar “tree, node” arguments. You can also set up more than 2 Local Effect edit areas and more than one Local Effect per phrase.
