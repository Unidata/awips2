Each standard file has a text product definition similar to that shown for the CCF. The first line declares our text product and states that it “inherits” all the library methods from the TextRules and SampleAnalysis classes. The next line begins the Definition section which is simply a Python dictionary describing settings for the text product. The following lines define the “type” of product and “displayName”. The Standard file is “inactivated” since the “displayName” is set to None. Another flag, “alwaysIncludeSnow” appears for this product.
