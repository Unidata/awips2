Thresholds and variables defined in the classes of the Text Product Infrastructure are overridden by repeating them in the Site Overrides File and modifying them there. Many thresholds and variables may be important to your product. They may already be included in the Standard file.  If so and you want to adjust them, copy them into your Site Overrides file from the Standard file.  If not, you will find them in the library modules which can be Viewed from the Utilities Window of the Define Text Products dialog. They can then be copied into the Site Overrides File and modified.
