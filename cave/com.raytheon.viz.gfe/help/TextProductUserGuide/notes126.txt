This is done through the _issuance_list method which has two sections. First, the possible narrative definitions appear.  The narrative definition for an AM issuance is shown.  The next section creates the list of dialog entries and the issuance information including the corresponding narrative definition.  Other information included is the start and end hours for the first period of the product, the expiration hour, labels to be used in the component.  For more details and a complete explanation of the Configurable Issuance capability, see the: Configurable Issuance section of the Text Product Reference Guide.
