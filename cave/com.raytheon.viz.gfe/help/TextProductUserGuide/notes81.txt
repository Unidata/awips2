If you want to customize the wording for describing various weather conditions, you can do so by overriding the "wxCoverageDescriptors", "wxTypeDescriptors", "wxIntensityDescriptors", and/or "wxAttributeDescriptors" In the example, we use pattern-matching syntax so that any weather key with a type of RW will be called "showers" instead of the default, "rain showers".  This is a very simple case.  This mechanism affords you much control over weather descriptors.  There is more information and examples at: Customizing Weather Descriptors section of the Text Product Reference Guide.
