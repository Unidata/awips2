In this section, we will see the Inheritance Hierarchy in action as we set-up the core products.  To set-up the core product, we first define a set of generic edit areas which some products require to  run “out-of-the-box.”  Next we suggest reading the Standard file documentation to become familiar with the settings for the product. There are three versions of each core product: Baseline, Regional, and Site. All products come delivered in the BASE user directory with the Baseline and Regional versions already activated and available from the “Products” menu of the Local Formatter Dialog.  The Site version must be activated by setting up a display name to appear in the Local Formatter dialog.  Once activated, we can then run the product.  At this point, we must customize the edit areas for for the local site. Finally, we verify that all three versions, Baseline, Regional, and Site run correctly with the customized edit areas.
