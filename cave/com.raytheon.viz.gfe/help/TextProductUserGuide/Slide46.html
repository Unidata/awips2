<p><p><big>Next, the product-specific methods will appear. For many products, there will be a _getAnalysisList method specifying which weather elements to sample and what summary statistics to generate for each of them. In the next section, there may be methods from the infrastructure which have been altered to operate differently for this particular product. Finally, we will find any product component definitions. These apply to narrative products and we will learn more about them in a later section.  Once again, remember that for the core products, this file is read-only.<br></big>
