Here are some suggestions for organizing your Local file into sections that will make trouble-shooting and understanding your Customizations easier.  Put all the code that you are overriding in one section, perhaps labeled by the source of the overridden code e.g. "Overrides from AreaFcst", "Overrides from ConfigVariables", "Overrides from FirePhrases", "Overrides from Region".  Be sure and comment the lines you are changing!  FSL has a Patches page with sections of code to include in your Local file to allow you to fix bugs before the next release is issued.  Put this code in it's own section and then clear out that section with each new release.  Sometimes you might find it useful to override methods and insert print statements to trouble-shoot a problem you might be having.  This is an excellent way to track problems and also learn how the code works.  However, be sure and put this code in a separate section and clear it out after the problem is fixed so that you will not miss upgrades and bug fixes to this code in subsequent releases.
