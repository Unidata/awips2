<center><h1> <a name="Evolution"></a>Evolution of GFESuite Text Products :
Policy and Project Overview</h1></center><hr>


The staff of the Forecast Systems Laboratory (FSL), working closely
with National Weather Service (NWS) field forecast offices, develops
the
grid-editing component of the Interactive Forecast Preparation System
(IFPS).&nbsp; This component called the Graphical Forecast Editor Suite
(GFESuite) allows forecasters to define a weather forecast in gridded
digital form. Once defined, the majority of NWS products are then
derived from this digital forecast database.
<p>Textual forecasts are among the most widely known products of the
National Weather Service.&nbsp; With the advent of digital forecasting
it is possible to produce these products automatically, allowing
forecasters to focus on meteorology rather than typing, and giving
consistency to the products.&nbsp; There is an established set of text
formatters included in the IFPS system. The FSL development team is
developing an alternative set of text formatters which produce standard
text products directly from the digital forecast database. </p>
<p>The GFESuite text formatters are being developed within the Rapid
Prototype Process (RPP), which delivers software in a rapid fashion and
incorporates forecaster feedback to quickly improve the system.&nbsp;
This section examines the phased development of the formatters and how
the feedback process works in each development phase. </p>

<h4>Exploration Phase</h4>
The GFESuite text formatter infrastructure was introduced by FSL as a
prototype at the National Weather Service Modernized Product Workshop
in
September of 1998. The infrastructure was written using C++ and Python,
which made it easy to extend and customize.&nbsp; During the next four
years, field forecasters explored the capabilities of the
infrastructure
to develop text products.&nbsp; During this Exploration Phase, the
infrastructure was enhanced to meet field needs.&nbsp; The system was
also kept backward-compatible as new functionality was added.
<p>By July of 2002, many local offices were successfully running
GFESuite formatters. However, the nature of this Exploration Phase led
to multiple versions of products, and support for these local versions
became a challenge. At this time, OS&amp;T developed the Local
Formatter
Infusion Plan which tasked the NWS, in concert with FSL, to develop a
core set of GFESuite text formatters as an alternative approach to the
established IFPS text product generation providing potential risk
reduction for the September 2003 IOC.&nbsp; By providing a core set of
standardized local formatters, the number of versions in the field will
be minimized while still allowing local customization. A Local Text
Formatter Team was formed consisting of forecasters representing all
regions and the FSL development team. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<h4>Consolidation Phase</h4>
With the adoption of this plan, we entered a new phase of local
formatter development, a Consolidation Phase.&nbsp; Instead of creating
multiple versions of products, we are consolidating and integrating the
products that were developed during the Exploration Phase. The
infrastructure is being enhanced and transformed to better meet the
needs of the local products.&nbsp; Backward compatibility during this
phase is not desirable since it requires 25-50% of the time available
for local formatter development.&nbsp; Even if time permitted, we would
not want to maintain old code; we want a system that is easy to
understand and maintain and not cluttered with older versions.
<p>Thus, we created a new set of infrastructure modules to replace the
older ones from the Exploration Phase.&nbsp; The older modules will
continue to be included in the GFESuite until the new products are
mature so that existing versions of products will still run.&nbsp; This
will ease the transition to the new products. </p>
<p>In October 2002, an initial set of new products was released for
testing and field feedback.&nbsp; The products were of varying maturity
levels. In general, products in a tabular format had higher levels of
maturity than the narrative-type products, which are more complex. As
the field becomes comfortable with each product, they may choose to use
them operationally. </p>

<h4>Feedback Process in the Exploration Phase</h4>
How does this all-important feedback process work?&nbsp; First, let's
look at the feedback process used during the Exploration phase.&nbsp; A
site would create or install a product and set up local
customizations.&nbsp; When a bug or desired enhancement was identified,
the focal point would make modifications writing new methods and code
to
override the existing ones. The focal point used an electronic bulletin
board, called the "listserver", for help with trouble-shooting from FSL
or from other forecasters.&nbsp; This resulted in a solution for each
site. The local sites were satisfied, and FSL enhanced the
infrastructure to meet their needs.&nbsp; However, this process
resulted
in multiple solutions to the same problem, and the solutions were not
available to all.
<h4>Feedback Process in the Consolidation Phase</h4>
In the Consolidation phase, we are integrating the existing versions of
products, and the infrastructure is changing dramatically.&nbsp; If we
used the same feedback process as we did for the Exploration phase, a
new release containing a changing infrastructure would cause the
modified new products to break.&nbsp; Depending on how much development
had been done, it could take days to weeks to recover.&nbsp; If the
product team and FSL continued to provide support for local sites
making
modifications to the code, the effort toward new products would be
reduced by 25-50%. In the end, each site would have a different
solution
to the same problem, and the enhancements may not be available to all
in
the standard product.
<p>The feedback process in the Consolidation Phase works differently,
as follows: A site installs the new product and makes local
customizations according to established "customization points"
documented for that product. When a bug or desired enhancement is
identified, instead of modifying the code at the local site, the focal
point submits a report to the listserver. The GFESuite Local Formatter
team responds to the problem or request. Often, due to the flexible
nature of Python, an interim solution can be given to the site.&nbsp;
This solution would then be available to all AND can be integrated back
into the standard product and infrastructure.&nbsp; As a result, the
individual sites are satisfied and the Local Formatter Team has
spent&nbsp; time on new product development.&nbsp; There is one
solution
to the same problem, which makes the products easier to understand and
maintain. </p>
<p>Using this feedback process, which minimizes local versions, a new
release is less likely to break the products. If there are
infrastructure changes that will effect products, they can be
identified. The time to adapt the products would be more on the order
of
hours rather than days or weeks.&nbsp; In this scenario, progress on
the
new products has been increased and the feedback process has served the
purpose of developing mature products for the benefit of all.&nbsp;
During the Consolidation Phase, there might be some cases where the
field offices are asked to settle for less functionality in the short
term in order to help build fully featured and maintainable products in
the long term. <br>

<p>Conclusion </p>
<p>The target date for operational GFESuite Local Text Formatters is
June 2003.&nbsp; The goal is to have a set of fully featured and
customizable products.&nbsp; At this time, the infrastructure will be
stable and mature.&nbsp; As a result of supporting the needs of a
diverse set of core products, the revised infrastructure will contain
excellent tools for field forecasters to begin a new Exploration Phase,
creating Modernized Products, the original goal and intention of the
GFESuite text formatters. <br>
