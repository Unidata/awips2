<a NAME="StyleSuggestions"></a>Style Suggestions</h2>

<ul>
<li>
Comment your code -- it really makes a difference, not only to others trying
to understand your code, but to you when you're trying to debug it.</li>

<li>
Name your variables meaningfully. A variable named&nbsp; "threshold"
versus "x" makes code much easier to read.</li>

<li>
Simple or Compound Statements</li>

<br>There are many ways to write software.&nbsp; You can separate each
step in a calculation on a separate line and assign it to variables, or
you can combine everything on one line.&nbsp; It all amounts to readability.
<p>Take this example of a compound statement, which computes a convective
/ total precipitation ratio, then creates a boolean grid which is based
on total precipitation from 0 to 0.02", and then creates a grid with ProbPrecip
values if there is precipitation (precipMask) and the ratio (precipRatio)
is less than 10%:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precipRatio = cp_SFC
/ (tp_SFC + 0.0001)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precipMask = logical_and(greater(tp_SFC,
0.0), less(tp_SFC, 0.02*25.4))</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grid = where(logical_and(precipMask,
less(precipRatio, 0.1)), ProbPrecip, 0.0)</tt>
<p>This same code fragment may be written in the following way. The precipRatio
is the calculated cp/tp ratio; precipPositive is a boolean grid where tp
> 0; precipLess2 is a boolean grid where tp &lt; 0.02" (which includes
zero); precipBetweenZeroAnd2 is a boolean grid where tp > 0 and tp &lt;
0.02"; precipRatioLess10 is a boolean grid where the precipRatio is less
than 10%, precipRatioAndLowPrecip is a boolean grid where tp > 0 and less
than 0.02", and where the cp/tp ratio is less than 0.1:
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precipRatio = cp_SFC
/ (tp_SFC + 0.0001)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precipPositive = greater(tp_SFC,
0.0)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precipLess2 = less(tp_SFC,
0.02*25.4)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precipBetweenZeroAnd2
= logical_and(precipPositive, precipLess2)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precipRatioLess10 =
less(precipRatio, 0.1)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; precipRatioAndLowPrecip
= logical_and(precipRatioLess10, precipBetweenZeroAnd2)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grid = where(precipRatioAndLowPrecip,
ProbPrecip, 0.0)</tt>
<p>The second fragment, though longer, is composed of simpler statements
and is easier to follow and read.&nbsp; Note also, that we have named the
variables to reflect the concepts and improve readability.</ul>

<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;Error Messages:&nbsp;&nbsp; Make sure you are running the GFE from
a terminal window so that you will see any Python error messages that occur
when you run your&nbsp; Smart&nbsp; Tool or Procedure. These messages will
give line numbers and descriptions that help you trace the origin of the
problem.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Print Statements:&nbsp; Using the Python "print" statement within
your Smart Tool or Procedure is one of the quickest ways to determine where
a problem is occurring and what might be causing it.&nbsp; Simply interspersing
"progress" statements such as the following throughout your tool can help:</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
print "Made it to this point"
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are some other
example "print" statements:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print "myVariable
=",&nbsp;&nbsp; myVariable
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # To print
Python Numeric array information:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print&nbsp;&nbsp;
"Dimensions of array T:",&nbsp; T.shape,&nbsp;&nbsp; "Value of T at point
20, 20: ", T[20][20]
<ul>
<li>
Simplify:&nbsp; If the problem is within a complicated method, simplify
it by commenting out the code and gradually introducing pieces of it.&nbsp;
Go back to something you know works and then start adding functionality
to it.</li>
</ul>
