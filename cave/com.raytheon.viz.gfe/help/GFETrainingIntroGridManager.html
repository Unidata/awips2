<hr width="100%">
<p>The Grid Manager is arguably the most complex component of the
GFE.
Its display presents an inventory of the gridded data in the forecast,
official or any other model database. With the Grid Manager you can
copy
all or a portion of another database into your forecast, temporally
interpolate
time periods to fill in undefined gaps in your forecast, remove grids
from
your forecast, and many other operations too numerous to mention
here.
The Grid Manager looks complex because it displays a large amount of
information
and offers a long list of features that help you manipulate the gridded
forecast data. While it's appearance can be intimidating, once you have
performed the exercises and understand how each of the features work,
you
will understand that it is necessarily complex. Refer to the <a

Manager Training Guide</a> for more details.
<p>Below is a snapshot of the Grid Manager component of the GFE along
with
labels that name its various parts.
