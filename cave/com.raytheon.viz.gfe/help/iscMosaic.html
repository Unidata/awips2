<h2><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h2>
The main use of the iscMosaic program is to merge and store grids
received
from the <a href="IntersiteCoordination.html">intersite coordination
of
grids</a> routine into your database.&nbsp; The iscMosaic program can
also
be used to merge other local data sets and for storing data, that is in
the appropriate netCDF format, into your database.&nbsp; Refer to the <a
 href="ifpnetCDF.html">ifpnetCDF
program's user guide</a> for details on the required format of the
netCDF
file.
<p>There are a variety of options available to iscMosaic.&nbsp; In the
basic mode, the contents of the specified netCDF file is merged into
the
existing dataset.&nbsp; Only those areas identified by the source site
identifier in the netCDF file are merged; the remainder of the existing
grids remain untouched.&nbsp; Using the various options, you can limit
the time range scope of the merge, limit the processing to one or just
a few weather elements, define an alternative merge mask or bypass the
merge and replace the entire grid, and zero out the existing grid
inventory
before beginning.
</p>
<p>Merging of grids is generally achived through "masking".&nbsp; The
mask
is an edit area.&nbsp; Be default the edit area mask is defined by the
site identifier field in each weather element of the incoming netCDF
file.&nbsp;
For example, if the grids in the netCDF were created by the <a
 href="ifpnetCDF.html">ifpnetCDF
program</a> at Cheyenne (CYS), and then the iscMosaic program was run
on
the data file at BOU, only the data defined by those grid points in the
Boulder's CYS edit area would be merged into the grids.&nbsp; The mask
can be disabled, or redefined when the iscMosaic program is run.
</p>
<p>The format of the input netCDF file is described in the <a
 href="netCDFFormat.html">netCDF
Format documentation</a>.
</p>
<p>The following three images are from BOU, CYS, and PUB, when merged
and
clipped to their CWA regions, the result is the fourth image.

<h3>
<a name="Restrictions"></a>Restrictions</h3>
The following restrictions apply to running this program:
<ul>
  <li>The -n and -a switches cannot be specified together since they
are
mutually
exclusive.</li>
  <li>If more than one -f switch is given, then the -x switch should
not be
given,
since it will not perform a merge.</li>
  <li>If more than one -f switch is given, then the -z switch cannot be
given.</li>
  <li>For purposes of intersite coordination, the following switches
must not
be specified: -s, -e, -x, -z, -n, -a.&nbsp; The following switch should
be specified: -b</li>
  <li>The program ignores the database time constraints, so if the data
to be
stored does not fall within a valid time constraint, the grid will not
be stored.&nbsp; This isn't a problem with the intersite coordination
database,
since its grids are stored into the ISC database, which has time
constraints
of 1 hour.</li>
  <li>If the "-d" switch specifies a database that does not currently
exist,
it will not be automatically created for you and the program will fail.</li>
</ul>
<hr width="100%">
<h2><a name="Examples"></a>Examples</h2>
This section describes the behavior of the iscMosaic program with the
various
options.
<h3><a name="DefaultBehavior"></a>Default Behavior</h3>
The default behavior, where the -h, -r, -d, and -f switches are given,
is to merge the grids in the input netCDF files into the destination
database.
<p>The following illustrates the concept of merging.&nbsp; Merging is
done
both temporally, and spatially.
<br>
&nbsp;
<table nosave="" cellspacing="10">
  <tbody>
    <tr nosave="">
      <td nosave=""><br>
      </td>
      <td>Original Grid, as viewed on the GFE at the remote site. Note
the inventory
for the grids.&nbsp; The merging will also perform temporal merges.</td>
      <td>Grid, after it has been remapped and clipped to the
destination's grid
domain.</td>

</table>
</p>
<p>The result of merging the grids is shown in the following
image.&nbsp;
Note the grids contained within the grid manager for Temperature.&nbsp;
The inventory is a temporal blend of the BOU, CYS, and PUB grids.
</p>
<p><img src="images/Mosaic_BOUCYSPUB.jpg" nosave="" height="543"
 width="381"></p>
<p>In the event that data is not available for a particular time period
from a site, the merged grid will contain missing data.&nbsp; The
missing
data is denoted by the weather element's minimum value, such as -30 for
temperature, calm for winds, and &lt;NoWx&gt; for weather grids.&nbsp;
Here
is an example of looping through a sequence of merged grids:
</p>
<p><img src="images/Mosaic_Loop.gif" nosave="" height="723" width="488"></p>
<h3><a name="Blanking"></a>Blanking</h3>
Blanking is used when when the incoming grids represent the entire
inventory
of grids for that weather element.&nbsp; Any grids, and any portions of
grids that do not overlap the incoming grids's valid times will be
blanked
when blanking is enabled.&nbsp; If blanking is disabled, then the
non-overlapping
portions of the grids will not have their data modified.
<p>The data written into a grid that has been "blanked" is basically
the
minimum data value or fill value over the area mask.
</p>

      <td>The second grid looks exactly the same as before the merge,

</table>
</p>
<h3><a name="ReplaceOnlyDoNotMerge"></a>Replace Only, Do Not Merge</h3>
If the replace only, do not merge flag is set via the command line,
then
an incoming grid will completely replace any overlapping existing grid,
rather than performing a merge.
<p>Here is an example of an existing grid and the result of performing
a replace.&nbsp; Note that the -a nor the -n switches were provided,
which
caused the grid to be masked over the PUB CWA:
<br>

    <tr>
      <td>Merged Grid before the PUB grid has been added.</td>
      <td>Merged (Replaced) grid after the PUB grid has been
added.&nbsp; The
PUB grid has completely replaced the CYS and BOU data sets since the -x
switch was used.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h3><a name="NoMask"></a>No Mask</h3>
The -n switch specifies that all valid data in the incoming grid will
be
used.&nbsp; No mask will be applied.&nbsp; Here is an example of
storing
a PUB grid using the -n switch.&nbsp; A merge is performed, but since
there
wasn't data previously from CYS, that area is blanked out.&nbsp; Note
the
blank area at the top of the grid; this area was not covered by PUB's
original
grid domain, and hence data values cannot be applied to it.
<p>The use of no mask is generally used only when replacing grids; it
is
used in conjunction with the -x switch.
</p>
<p><img src="images/Mosaic_NoMask.jpg" nosave="" height="543"
 width="379"><br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h3><a name="AlternativeMask"></a>Alternative Mask</h3>
The user may specifify an alternative mask, which is the name of an
edit
area. In this example, the original data before the merge is shown, the
edit area is outlined in the second image, and those data portions
within
the incoming file that are contained within the named edit area are
merged.

<h2><a name="SimpleStorageofGrids"></a>Simple Storage of Grids</h2>
Another use for the iscMosaic program is to simply store grids from
netCDF
into the server.&nbsp; Of course the <a href="#RequiredFormat">format
of
the file</a> must meet the appropriate standards for the iscMosaic
program
to recognize the data.
<p>It is assumed that you will completely want to replace any existing
grids in the server. The following command line switches are normally
used
for this purpose:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<table nosave="" border="1" width="100%">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>-h hostname</td>
      <td>Hostname upon which EDEX is running</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-r portNumber</td>
      <td>RPC port number upon which EDEX is handling requests</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-d databaseOutputID</td>
      <td>Name of the output database to store the grids</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-f inputFile</td>
      <td>Name of the input netCDF file</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-x</td>
      <td>Replace grids, do not merge.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-z</td>
      <td>Erase all grids before storing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>-n</td>
      <td>Do not mask the grids upon storage</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>In addition, if you want to completely replace all existing data,
then
you will probably want to use all of the above switches.

<h2><a name="translationRules"></a>Translation Rules</h2>
When the -T switch is specified and incoming data does not conform to
"known values" by the EDEX definition, iscMosaic will attempt to
translate the data into "known values". The iscMosaic
log file will indicate which values were translated. If the
-w switch is present, then similar information will be sent to the GFEs
as alert (orange) messages on the ISC status bar.<br>
<br>
<h3>Discrete Data</h3>
<ol>
  <li>If "overlapping" data is input (as denoted by the key^key
format), and EDEX is not configured for this weather element
to have overlapping data, then only the first key is
used.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, "FW.A^SV.A" will translate into
"FW.A".</li>
  <li>If data containing aux data fields is input and the field length
exceeds EDEX configuration, then the aux data field will be
dropped. For example, if the aux data field is configured
to be a maximum of 4 characters and "FW.A:12345" is input, it will be
translated into "FW.A".</li>
  <li>If data containing an unknown key is input, then the data will be
translated into the first defined value in EDEX.&nbsp;&nbsp;
For many configurations including Hazards, this value is
"&lt;None&gt;". For example, if "XY.Z" is input, it will be
translated into "&lt;None&gt;".<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Weather Data</h3>
<ol>
  <li>If an unknown visibility is input, then the visibility will be
translated into the first configured visibility element in
EDEX, which is normally &lt;NoVis&gt;.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,
"Sct:RW:-:52M:" will translate into "Sct:RW:-:&lt;NoVis&gt;".</li>
  <li>If an unknown type is input, then the type and all associated
fields will be translated into the first configured type element in
EDEX, which is normally &lt;NoWx&gt;. For example,
"Sct:ZZZ:+:&lt;NoVis&gt;:" will translate into
"&lt;NoCov&gt;:&lt;NoWx&gt;:&lt;NoInten&gt;:&lt;NoVis&gt;:".</li>
  <li>If an unknown coverage is input, then the coverage will be
translated into the first configured coverage for that weather
type.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, "XXX:R:+:&lt;NoVis&gt;:" will translate
into "Wide:R:+:&lt;NoVis&gt;:".</li>
  <li>If an unknown intensity is input, then the intensity will be
translated into the first configured intensity for that weather
type.&nbsp; For example, "Wide:R:?:&lt;NoVis&gt;:" will translate into
"Wide:R:--:&lt;NoVis&gt;:".</li>
  <li>If an unknown attribute is input, then the attribute will be
removed.&nbsp;&nbsp; For examplle,
"Wide:T:&lt;NoInten&gt;:&lt;NoVis&gt;:DmgW,LgA,XYZ" will translate into
"Wide:T:&lt;NoInten&gt;&lt;NoVis&gt;:DmgW,LgA".<br>
  </li>
