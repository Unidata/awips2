<h1 align=center>Editing Temporal Data in Relative Mode</h1>
<hr width="100%">

<ul>
<li CLASS="4Heading">
<b>Purpose:</b> Modify scalar grid values in Relative Edit mode</li>
</ul>

<div CLASS="Body">The previous temporal editor exercises demonstrated how
TE Absolute mode works. Every time you make a change to the temporal value,
that value is assigned to the entire area you selected in the spatial editor.
TE Relative mode works differently in that the relative change is applied
to the selected area. For example, if you made a +5 degree change to your
temperature time-series, 5 degrees is added to every point in the selected
area. This preserves the relative gradients in the area which is sometimes
very desirable.</div>

<div CLASS="Body">Before you begin: Set up your GFE so that the spatial
and temporal editors are visible. Load T (temperature) via the Weather
Element->Weather Element Browser... dialog if T is not loaded already.</div>

<div CLASS="Step-First">From the main menu, check to make sure that GFE->Editing
Preferences->Temporal Editor Mode: Relative is on.</div>

<li CLASS="Step">
Make, or find a temperature grid and display it as an image in the spatial
editor.</li>

<li CLASS="Step">
Use the Select Points tool to define an edit area the size of a few counties.
Try to select an area where there is a temperature gradient.</li>

<li CLASS="Step">
Find the T (temperature) weather element in the temporal editor. Vertically
stretch the size of the temporal editor pane so that there's plenty of
room to see the time series display.</li>

<li CLASS="Step">
In the temporal scale, located to the left of the time series display,
click MB2 to zoom in until the minimum and maximum values are about 20
degrees F apart.</li>

<li CLASS="Step">
Find the data point in the time series that represents the grid displayed
in the spatial editor. This point is identified by the dotted yellow line.</li>

<li CLASS="Step">
Adjust this data point about 5 to 10 degrees higher. Note the change in
the spatial editor display. The 5-10 degree change you applied to the time-series
point has been applied to all of the points inside the selected area. The
gradient that was present before the temporal edit should still exist.</li>

<li CLASS="Step">
Use the MB1 drag operation in the temporal editor to modify several grids
with the same operation. Step through these edited grids to verify that
the data were modified inside the selected area.</li>
