<p><p><big>What this means is that if you look up the official forecast for a National Weather service office, it is likely that the words you read were generated by softward written here at FSL.

And now this infrastructure, bolstered by our experience with the core products can be used to create new and innovative products such as point-casts, traveler's forecasts and products for other programs such as Aviation and River Forecast products.<br><br><br></big>
