<p><p><big>The directives for the core products include the Zone Forecast Product, Coastal Waters Forecast, Fire Weather Forecast as well as tables such as the Coded Cities Forecast. There are about 12 in all. The directives needed to be encoded into the baseline software, but that's only half the story.  These directives act only as guidelines and each local office has its own variations and preferences based on the geographic and meteorological characteristics of its domain.  So we began a series of 14 releases of the software to the forecasters on our team for them to try out the code, make sure it could handle their local customizations and give us bug reports and requests for enhancements. <br><br><br></big>
