<p><p><big>We introduced an experimental prototype in 1998 at the Modernized Product<br>Workshop as a way  to create new innovative text products.  The field<br>forecasters picked up on this new approach which, like Smart Tools, uses<br>Python to make it extendable and easy to customize to the Local site.  They<br>explored the use of this technology to create new products as well as to work<br>with the legacy text products. This approach became so popular that in August<br>2002, the NWS asked FSL in concert with field forecasters to write a set of<br>core products as an alternative to the existing products. This was quite an<br>undertaking and the first thing we did was to form a Focus Group of about 25<br>motivated forecasters who had been working with the text product framework.<br><br><br></big>
