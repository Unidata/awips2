<p><p><big>As we turn our attention to improving the quality of the grids by injecting science at every step of the forecast process, we can leverage off of our experience with the Text Product project.  We can again use a Focus Group to understand the forecasters. challenges in the digital world.  We will tackle problems such as enforcing consistency between the many weather elements represented in the grids and creating 4-dimensional smart tools that operate in space and time over multiple elements. Our experience in dealing with the complexities and dependencies inherent in the problem of text generation will serve us well as we formulate innovative processing techniques for the scientific challenges ahead.<br><br><br></big>
