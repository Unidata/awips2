What this means is that if you look up the official forecast for a National Weather service office, it is likely that the words you read were generated by softward written here at FSL.  Similarly, if you listen to NOAA weather radio, the words you here are likely to be a result of this system.  And now this infrastructure, bolstered by our experience with the core products can be used to create new and innovative products such as point-casts, traveler's forecasts and products for other programs such as Aviation and River Forecast products.
