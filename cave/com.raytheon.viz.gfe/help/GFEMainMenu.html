<h4>
<a name="MissingDataMode"></a>Missing Data Mode</h4>
<div class="4Heading">The Missing Data Mode specifies how to handle
missing
data when running a Smart Tool. The options are:</div>
<ul>
  <li class="4Heading">Stop on Missing Data: The system stops execution
of the Smart Tool if
requested
data is missing.</li>
  <li class="4Heading">Skip on Missing Data: The system will skip grids
for which there is
missing
data. A User Alert message will report which grids were skipped.</li>
  <li class="4Heading">Create on Missing Data: The system will
automatically interpolate grids
to supply the missing grids. A User Alert message will report which
grids
were created through interpolation. Note that if a grid to be created
is
not between two existing grids, it will not be extrapolated. In this
case,
the grid being edited will be skipped. If the created grids are in the
Fcst database, they will be added to the Fcst database. If running from
the GFE, they can be optionally be saved by the user. If running in
background
mode, they will be automatically saved at the end of the procedure with
all other edited grids. If the created grids are in a non-mutable
database,
they will not be added to the database and will be discarded after
execution
of the tool.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
<a name="TemporalEditorMode:Relative"></a>Temporal Editor Mode: Relative</h4>
Allows the user to choose the Temporal Editor Mode to be either
Relative
or Absolute. If the button is selected, the mode is Relative.
Otherwise,
the mode is Absolute. The default is as set for
TemporalEditorAbsoluteEditMode
in the gfe configuration file.
<p>When performing an edit in the absolute mode, each point in the Edit
Area will be set to the value indicated in the Temporal Editor. When
performing
an edit in the relative mode, each point in the Edit Area will be
incremented
or decremented by the magnitude of the edit in the Temporal Editor.
</p>
<h4><a name="VectorEditMode"></a>Vector Editor Mode</h4>
Allows the user to control the component of the data to be modified
when
performing an Edit Action. The possible options are Magnitude Only,
Direction
Only, or Both. The default is as set for WindEditMode in the gfe
configuration
file. This may also be set from the <a
 href="ButtonBarDialogs.html#VectorPickUpValueDialog">Vector
PickUp Dialog</a>.
<br>
<h4><a name="SmoothingAlgorithm"></a>Smoothing Algorithm</h4>
Allows the user to control the amount (area) of smoothing.&nbsp; The
popup
menu items reflect the smoothing influence by the number of grid
cells.
The Smoothing default value and the selection of values may be <a
 href="gfeConfig_Algor.html#SmoothingAlgorithm">configured</a>
in the gfe configuration file.
<h4><a name="Weather:Combine"></a>Wx/Discrete: Combine</h4>
Allows the user to control whether an edit action replaces the existing
weather/discrete data or combines the new value with the existing
weather/discrete
data. If the button is selected, an edit action will combine
weather/discrete
data. Otherwise, the weather/discrete data will be replaced. The
default
is as set for WeatherDiscreteCombineMode in the gfe configuration
file.
The Weather Combine Mode may also be set from the <a
 href="ButtonBarDialogs.html#WeatherPickUpValueDialog">Weather
PickUp Dialog</a> and <a
 href="ButtonBarDialogs.html#DiscretePickUpValueDialog">Discrete
PickUp Dialog</a>.
<h4><a name="SelectGridsWhenStepping"></a>Select Grids When Stepping</h4>
Specifies whether the selection time range will track the spatial
editor
time when time stepping.&nbsp; Time stepping is accomplished using the
<a href="Toolbar.html#StepBack">GFE
toolbar stepping buttons</a> or the <a href="keys.html">keyboard
shortcuts</a>.
When this preference is enabled (i.e., yes), the selection time range
will
be set to:
<ul>
  <li>the one hour period surrounding the spatial editor time, if there
is no
active weather element, or</li>
  <li>the time constraint box for the active weather element, if there
is no
grid that intersects the spatial editor time, or</li>
  <li>the valid time of the grid for the active weather element that
intersects
the spatial editor time.</li>
</ul>
In addition, all weather elements except the active weather element
will
be deselected.
<p>When this preference is disabled (i.e., no), the selection time
range,
and the set of selected weather elements will not change when using the
<a href="Toolbar.html#StepBack">GFE
toolbar step buttons</a> and
<a href="keys.html">keyboard shortcuts</a>.
