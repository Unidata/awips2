<br>
<br>
The GHG Monitor is used to monitor hazards in effect. It consists of
a spreadsheet showing various information about each hazard, a map
showing the spatial location of each hazard, a text displaying showing
the contents of some of the products, and an alert system to inform
forecasters when products are about to expire.
The user can define various display filters to just show the
information desired, and can save configurations for later use.
The GHG Monitor may be launched either from the command line directly,
or from the Products menu on the GFE.<br>
<br>
The GHG Monitor is based off the <a href="VTEC.html">VTEC Active Table</a>,
which is created by
the VTEC Decoder. The active table is used by the GFE formatters to
determine changes in state of VTEC actions and events. Currently
the GHG Monitor can only monitor products that are VTEC-enabled.<br>
<br>
The GHG Monitor is the basis for the GHG Administrative Editor, which
allows an administrator to view and edit the VTEC active table.<br>

<h2><a name="CommandLine"></a>Command Line and Starting GHGMonitor</h2>
GHGMonitor may be started through the GFE main menu Products -&gt; GHG
Monitor entry, or directly from the command line. If started
through the GFE, then the <a href="GFEStartup.html#special">GFE
startup mode</a> will be sent through to the GHGMonitor, e.g., if the
GFE is started in PRACTICE mode, then the GHG Monitor will start in
PRACTICE mode.<br>
<br>
The command line for GHGMonitor is:<br>
<br>
ghgMonitor <tt>[-h hostname] [-p portNumber] [-u userName] [-t
activeTableName]</tt> <br>
<br>
<table nosave="" border="1" width="100%">

<h2><a name="Components"></a>Components

The GHG Monitor consists of a main menu bar, display selector, map and
text area, spreadsheet area, and status bar:<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/GHGMonitor1.png" style="width: 864px; height: 633px;"><br>
</div>
<br>
<h3>Main Menu Bar</h3>
The Main Menu Bar contains common commands used to configure the GHG
Monitor. Most of the control of the GHG Monitor is
performed through the Main Menu Bar entries, with the exception of
spreadsheet and map "selections".<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;">Display Selector</span></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;"></span></h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-family: monospace;"></span>The
Display Selector consists of two tabs which control a "Paned
Window".&nbsp; The options are:<br>
<br>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-weight: bold;">Tab <br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top; font-weight: bold;">Meaning<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Text<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The Text tab selects the Text
Display.&nbsp; The Text Display shows the captured text for the
selections made on the Map or Spreadsheet.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Map<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">The Map tab selects the Map
Display.&nbsp; The Map Display shows the geographical layout for the
hazard.&nbsp; Selections may also be made on the Map Display.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
<h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Map
and Text Area</span></span></h3>
The Map and Text Area can be toggled between the Map and Text using the
Display Selector.&nbsp; The Map shows a geographic layout of the area
with a variety of map types available (e.g., FIPS, Marine, Fire
Weather, Public Zones).&nbsp; Zones/Areas are highlighted on the Map
display to indicate the extent of a selected hazard.&nbsp; The Map is
also used to select/query a zone/area for all of its associated hazards.<br>
<br>
The Text Area shows the captured text from a product.&nbsp; Not all
products have captured text.&nbsp; Captured text consists of the
overview section as well as the text within a segment. <br>
<br>
<h3>Spreadsheet Area</h3>
The Spreadsheet Area is the main monitor area in the GHG Monitor and
contains a sorted list of hazards.&nbsp; The user has full control over
the columns that are displayed, as well as the display filter to
control the hazards to display.&nbsp; Colors are used in the
Spreadsheet Area to denote alerts for upcoming product purge times,
selection of what hazard the Map display is showing, and selection of
what hazard the Map selection is showing, as well as Test products.<br>
<br>
<h3>Status Bar</h3>
The Status Bar consists of the status field, an indicator showing the
name of the current display filter. The status field works just like 
the Status Bar in the GFE.<br>
<br>
<h3>Additional Features</h3>
The GHG Monitor may be resized.&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition, the size of
the map/text display and spreadsheet can be changed using the Pane
Resizer, which is seen between the map/text and spreadsheet components
of the monitor.<br>
<br>
Since there may be a large amount of data in the spreadsheet and text
display, scroll bars are provided to scroll around in order to view the
entire spreadsheet. The map display may also be zoomed and
roamed to show additional detail.<br>
<br>
The current configuration may be "saved", and subsequent restarts of
the GHG Monitor will use the saved configuration.<br>
<br>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2><a name="HowToUse"></a>How To Use</h2>
Once the GHG Monitor is started, it will read the VTEC active table and
based on its filtering setup, will display a set of
hazards. The user can determine the geographical extent of
any of these hazards simply be clicking on a cell in the
Spreadsheet. The Map will then identify the affected
zones. Selecting the Text display will show the captured
text for that hazard. The user may bring up the display filter
dialog to change the hazards that are displayed, and may use the
"Columns" pull-down menu to add or remove details about each
hazard. As the product purge time approaches, the GHG
Monitor alert system will alert the forecaster up to three times.&nbsp;
The alerts consist of highlighting the rows of the spreadsheet based on
the alert level, as well as displaying a "banner" message. The
user may click on a zone in the Map display and all hazards that are
occurring in that zone will be highlighted in the spreadsheet.<br>
<br>
The GHG Monitor will automatically update as the hazard state changes
with the arrival of new products. During the update period, the
watch cursor will be displayed.<br>
<br>
All of the menus may be torn-away. The Display Filter Dialog is
non-modal and may be displayed continuously as changes are made.
The Alert Filter Dialog and other dialogs are modal and thus the user
must respond to the dialog prior to other operations.<br>
<br>
The initial state of the GHG Monitor is either the default
configuration, or the previously saved configuration. Users can
configure the GHG Monitor to their tastes, and then save the
configuration. Each time the GHG Monitor is started (for that
user), the saved configuration will be restored.<br>
<br>

NOTE: Some displayed "Pil"s may not match the actual product pil.&nbsp;
This occurs for hazards that are issued with one PIL and
updated/cancelled using another PIL.&nbsp; Examples are the Tornado
Warning (TO.W) which is issued in the TOR product and updated/cancelled
in the SVS product.&nbsp; The monitor will show TOR for the updates and
cancels.&nbsp; The VTECPartners VTEC_MAPPED_PILS entry defines this
relationship.<br>

<h2><a name="Spreadsheet"></a>Spreadsheet</h2>
The GHG Monitor Spreadsheet is the heart of the monitor.&nbsp; It
displays hazards derived from the VTEC active table.&nbsp; The user can
choose to display various information about each hazard using the <a
 href="#Column">Column</a> menu.&nbsp;&nbsp; The user can choose to
filter out certain events through the <a href="#DisplayFilter">Display
Filter Dialog</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hazards are sorted by the column
highlighted, Purge in this example. Normally the color of the
spreadsheet appears as follows, when no alerts or user selections are
in effect:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/GHGMonitor2.png"><br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
If the user clicks on a row in the spreadsheet, the map and text
displays will represent the geographical location and captured product
text for that hazard.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here is an example of&nbsp; the user
clicking on a hazard record in order to view the map and text
associated with the record; the spreadsheet record is highlighted in
blue/white:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/GHGMonitor3.png" style="width: 987px; height: 124px;"><br>
</div>
<br>
Colors are also used to alert the forecaster that a product is about to
expire.&nbsp; The "Alert1" color is used for the first alert.&nbsp; The
default is blue text on a yellow background as shown.&nbsp; The GHG
Monitor clearly shows the hazards and their related products that will
soon expire:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/GHGMonitor4.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
The "Alert2" color is used for the second level of alerts.&nbsp; The
default is white text on a red background as shown:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/GHGMonitor5.png" style="width: 990px; height: 129px;"><br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
The final alert occurs when the product purge time has passed.&nbsp;
The default color is white text on a magenta background as shown
below.&nbsp; The "Expired" alert color is used on the record until
either the forecaster replaces the record with a new product, or the
event ending time passes:<br>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/GHGMonitor8.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
Since VTEC "Test" products do not represent real hazards, the VTEC
hazard records found in a Test product use the "Test" color, which
defaults to a dark gray box with white lettering as shown:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/GHGMonitor6.png" style="width: 991px; height: 128px;"><br>
</div>
<br>
Multiple highlighting is possible on the spreadsheet.&nbsp; In the
following example, all records are highlighted (yellow) with the
"Alert1" status.&nbsp; The first record has alternating colors of
yellow and dark gray.&nbsp; The dark gray indicates that the first
product is a Test product.&nbsp; The second record shows three
highlighting types together: Alert1, Test, and user-selected.&nbsp; In
the cases of multiple highlighting the columns are alternating colors
-- the specific color in a column has no meaning, i.e., you must look
at all of the colors in a row to determine the record's complete state:<br>

<h3>User Actions</h3>
The following user actions are supported on the spreadsheet:<br>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">MB1 click on a column header<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Sorts the data in the
spreadsheet by the data in that column.&nbsp; Alternating clicks will
sort in ascending order, then decending order. The column header will
highlight to indicate that the spreadsheet is sorted by that
column.&nbsp; There is no indicator, other than inspecting the data
itself, to indicate whether the spreadsheet is sorted in ascending or
decending order.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">MB1 click on a cell in the
spreadsheet<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Highlights the row with the
"Monitor Selection" color, and then indicates on the map the
geographical location of the hazard, and on the text display the
captured text of the issued product.&nbsp; Not all hazards have
associated captured text.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
Note that only one hazard record may be manually selected on the
spreadsheet.&nbsp; Multiple records are not allowed due to
ambiguities.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is an exception to this and that
involves selection of a zone on the map display.<br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
</div>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2><a name="MapDisplayAndControl"></a>Map Display and Control</h2>
The Map Display is used to graphically depict the geographical extent
of a hazard. The map background type is automatically chosen
based on the set of zones that contain a hazard. The software
will automatically choose the FIPS, Public, Fire Weather, or Marine map
backgrounds. You can also manually choose a map background
from the <a href="#MapMenu">Map</a> menu; however, the only useful
purpose of manually chosing a map is to next select a zone to query its
hazards.<br>
<br>
The map is drawn using shapefile data available from EDEX.
Zones that are your responsibility are drawn with yellow outlines and
zones that belong to another WFO are drawn with black outlines.&nbsp;
The background color of the zone is dark gray. If a user
selects a hazard on the Spreadsheet, the corresponding zones will be
highlighted using a blue fill color, as shown in the following image:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/GHGMonitor9.png" style="width: 502px; height: 318px;"><br>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
The <a href="#MapMenu">Map</a> menu may be used to zoom in on the map
background and the scroll bars are used to scroll around the map.
Resizing the window larger will simply show more of the map until the
entire map is shown, then it enlarges the map. Resizing the
window smaller will show smaller and smaller sections of the map.
You can restore the "No Zoom" by using the <a href="#MapMenu">Map</a>
menu. The menu also provides a toggle to turn on/off the zone
labels. Examples of the zoomed map with and without labels is shown
below. Note the spreadsheet display shows the Expired alert for
the FA.A hazard, but the zones appearing in the map belong to the SN.Y
beginning at 02z 08-Jan-05:<br>
</div>
</div>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/GHGMonitor10.png" style="width: 508px; height: 658px;">&nbsp;
<img alt="" src="images/GHGMonitor11.png"
 style="width: 507px; height: 662px;"><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">The map labels are drawn in the exact
center of each zone.&nbsp; This technique works well for rectangular
zones, but not good for irregularily shaped zones. Use caution when
using the zone labels for identification.&nbsp;&nbsp; Decluttering is
applied to the zone labels, thus not all zone labels will necessarily
show up at a particular map size.<br>
<br>
The other purpose of the map is to query the hazards based on a
zone.&nbsp; In the example below, the user clicked in the COZ045
zone.&nbsp; The software examined all of its hazard records and
highlighted those in the spreadsheet that contain the COZ045
zone.&nbsp; It then examined the records and highlighted all of the
zones in the map that are common to the selected records.&nbsp; Thus in
the example below, the WS.A and SN.Y both affect COZ045.&nbsp; They
also affect the other highlighted zones shown in the map too.&nbsp; The
highlighted zones in the map are the logical "AND" of the events, thus
if event A covered 10 zones and event B covered 5 of the same zones and
5 other zones, clicking on one of those 5 zones would highlight all
common zones to the event A and event B hazard as well as highlight
event A and B in the spreadsheet.&nbsp; Switching to the Text display
would show all of the captured text for all of the hazards that have
been identified and marked selected.<br>
<br>
Note the spreadsheet also contains an expired entry as shown in
magenta.&nbsp; We can tell that the expired entry did not affect the
highlighted zones in the map since the magenta row is a solid row and
isn't interspersed with the cyan color.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/GHGMonitor12.png" style="width: 1022px; height: 661px;"><br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<h3>User Actions</h3>
The following user actions are supported on the map display:<br>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="1" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">MB1 click on a zone on the map.<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">Highlights all rows in the
spreadsheet that contain a hazard affecting the clicked-upon zone. The
Map display in turn will show all of the zones in common for those
selected rows in the spreadsheet using the "cyan" default color.&nbsp;
The Text display will show the captured text from all of the products
identified by the selected rows in the spreadsheet.<br>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
Depending upon your <a href="#DisplayFilter">Display Filter</a>
settings, additional records may be added to the spreadsheet when
clicking on the map. The display filter also is used to
determine whether clicking on a map zone will include records that are
already expired or are old events.<br>
</div>
</div>
<br>
</div>
</div>
<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2><a name="TextDisplay"></a>Text Display</h2>
The Text Display is used in conjunction with Map and Spreadsheet
selections. If the user clicks on a spreadsheet row, or
clicks on a map zone, the appropriate hazards are highlighted in the
spreadsheet. At the same time, the text display will show the
overview text and segment text relating to those hazards.
Scroll bars on the text display permit the user to see the entire set
of text. Not all products are supported with captured text.<br>
<br>
Only segmented products have overview text. Overview text is
defined as the text between the MND header and the first UGC
line. Segment text is defined as the text within each segment
between the end of the UGC/Date block and the $$ segment ending
characters.<br>
<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2><a name="DisplayFIlter"></a>Display Filter</h2>
The Display Filter is a very important aspect to the GHG Monitor.
Depending upon the display filter settings, you may end up with just a
few entries, or hundreds of entries on the spreadsheet. A default
display filter is provided with the software and the user can always
select the default filter from the <a href="#FilterMenu">Filter</a>
menu. The Display Filter Dialog is used to define the filter and
it is also accessed from the <a href="#FilterMenu">Filter</a>
menu. The filtering technique consists of four steps:<br>
<ul>
  <li>the raw records are read from the VTEC active table.&nbsp; These
records are organized by hazard and zone, thus a WS.W occupying 10
zones would take 10 records.</li>
  <li>the records are consolidated based on the filter
options. Options such as "Combine GeoIDs" will take
identical hazards (same start time, ending time, phen/sig, product pil)
that are occurring in different zones and combines them into one record.</li>
  <li>the remaining records are passed through the display
filter. Depending upon the current filter settings, filters out
records that are old (i.e., old events), filters out records that
belong to another WFO, filters out records based on product pil, or
phen/sig. <br>
  </li>
  <li>the remaining records are sorted according to the sort criteria
and then displayed in the spreadsheet.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="0" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">This is the GHG Monitor Filter
Dialog.&nbsp; The upper section consists of the listbox
options. Selecting items from the listbox will change the
filtering. If a particular column/listbox contains no
highlighted sections, it is intrepreted as if all of the sections were
highlighted. In the example, only the CON, EXA, EXB, EXT, and NEW
actions will be shown in the spreadsheet; all other records will be
filtered out. All Phen/Sig and Pils will be shown since no
entries are highlighted in those two listboxes. Buttons at
the bottom of each listbox allow quick selection and deselection of all
entries.<br>
      <br>
The "Show Current Hazards Only" button will filter the displayed set of
entries in the listbox based on those records actually found and is a
quick way to get an overview summary of all hazards.
"Current Hazards" are considered those hazards found in the VTEC active
table AND those hazards whose ending time or purge time has not yet
passed.<br>
      <br>
The "Show Advanced Columns" is intended for advanced users to examine
other hazard aspects, such as filtering by geographical id (e.g.,
zone), segment number, and ETN number. The regular user will not
need this capability, but it is useful for diagnostics.<br>
      <br>
The Record Consolidation section and the Filter Override section
provides additional control on what records will appear in the
Spreadsheet.<br>

<br>
The Record Consolidation section contains four options. For
normal use, these options should always be turned on which will
minimize the number of records shown in the spreadsheet.
Like events will be combined based on the state of the record
consolidation values. Records that have a different event
starting or ending time, phen/sig (hazard), originating office WFO,
event tracking number, product pil, or issuance time will NEVER be
combined. The same hazard is identified by the same starting and
ending time, the same issuance time, same product pil, originating
office, event tracking number, and hazard type (phen/sig).<br>

The Display Filter offers many choices on filtering which events are to
be seen on the GHG Monitor's spreadsheet. At any time, the user
can save the current state of the filter as a named filter.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Named filters may be loaded, saved, and deleted from the <a
 href="#FilterMenu%5C">Filter</a> menu. There is an indicator on
the status bar showing the name of the current filter that is in
effect.&nbsp; The indicator shows "&lt;Default&gt;" when the default
filter is chosen and "&lt;Initial&gt;" when the initial display filter
is loaded.<br>
<br>
Named Display Filters are saved and loaded with the overall GHG
Configuration. The GHG Configuration may be saved and loaded from
the <a href="#FileMenu">File</a> menu.<br>
<br>
Changes in the Display Filter will deselect any Map or Spreadsheet
selections that may be present.<br>
<br>
NOTE: Some displayed "Pil"s may not match the actual product pil.
This occurs for hazards that are issued with one PIL and updated/cancelled
using another PIL. Examples are the Tornado Warning (TO.W) which
is issued in the TOR product and updated/cancelled in the SVS
product. The monitor will show TOR for the updates and cancels. The
VTECPartners VTEC_MAPPED_PILS entry defines this relationship.

<h2><a name="AlertFilter"></a>Alert Characteristics</h2>
One of the primary purposes of the GHG Monitor is to remind forecasters
that products are about to expire and updates/replacements are
necessary. The GHG Monitor offers three types of alerts: Alert1,
Alert2, and Expired alerts. The characteristics of these alerts
are set by the GHG Monitor Alert Dialog. When an alert is
"fired", an alert banner (if desired) is displayed and the affected
hazards in the Spreadsheet are highlighted, as shown:<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""
 src="images/GHGMonitor22.png"><br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
<table style="width: 100%; text-align: left;" border="0" cellpadding="2"
 cellspacing="2">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;"><br>
The Alert Dialog is accessed from the <a
 href="GHGMonitor.html#AlertMenu">Alert</a> menu.&nbsp; Through the
"Enable Alert1", "Enable Alert2", and "Enabled Expired" checkbuttons,
the user can turn on or off the alerts. Each of these alert types
also has a "Show Banner" checkbutton. If enabled, then a banner
alert will be displayed when the alert is fired. If disabled,
then only the spreadsheet will be highlighted.<br>
      <br>
The Display Filter "Include Alerts" checkbutton needs to be enabled in
order to see all alerts. Without that checkbutton enabled, it is
possible that the forecaster may have filtered out the hazards causing
the alerts.<br>
      <br>
The scales are used to define the number of minutes prior to the
product purge time (expire time) that the alert will trigger. The
"Expired" alert type does not permit adjustment of the scale and is
always fixed at 0 minutes.<br>
      </td>
      <td style="vertical-align: top;">
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<br>
The "Alert for My WFO Only" checkbutton limits alerts to only my
WFO. If cleared, then you will receive alerts for products
generated by other WFOs. The "Alert for TEST Products"
indicates whether alerts will be issued for products in the VTEC Test
mode. <br>
<br>
The three listboxes define the Actions, Phen.Sig, and Pil for the
alerts. This allows the user to only alert on certain events.<br>
<br>
Alert criteria is checked once each minute to determine if there are
new events that require alerting. Once an alert has been
triggered for a particular event, the entry in the spreadsheet will be
changed to that alert color. If a banner alert was requested, the
banner alert is displayed. The spreadsheet alert will
continue until either a different alert type is displayed, or until
that record is removed from the spreadsheet. Records are removed
from the spreadsheet either manually using the Display Filter, or by
new events that supercede the previous event.<br>

<h3>Colors</h3>
The spreadsheet and alert colors may be configured by the user from the
Appearance-&gt;Colors menu entry. The GHG Monitor Color Choice
Dialog will be displayed allowing the user to configure seven different
color schemes. For each scheme there is a Text Color (foreground)
and a Background Color. The user chooses the Color Scheme to
modify, then uses the two color choosers to set the color, then uses
"Apply Colors" to make the change. Refer to the <a
 href="ColorDialogs.html#ColorChooser">Color Chooser Dialog</a> on how
to use the color wheel and hue, saturation, and brightness sliders.<br>
