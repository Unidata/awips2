<h1 class="3Heading"><a name="SpatialEditor"></a>Spatial Editor Popup
Menu</h1>
Selecting MB3 over the Spatial Editor opens a sub-menu with the
following
items:
<br>
<ul>
  <li>A list of edit tools as defined in the GFE configuration file.
Some of
the basic tools that may appear are:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Assign_Value -- Assigns pick-up value to active edit area over
active
time
range.</li>
    <li>AdjustValue_Down -- Decrements grid points within the active
edit area
and
time range by the Delta Value.</li>
    <li>AdjustValue_Up -- Increments grid points within the active edit
area and
time range by the Delta Value.</li>
    <li>Smooth -- Smooths grid points within the active edit area over
the
active
time range.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Undo Grid Edit -- Reverses the last grid edit operation that was
performed.&nbsp;
You are only able to reverse the very last operation -- but you can
undo
the last Undo.</li>
  <li>Undo Edit Area -- Reverses the last Edit Area operation that was
performed
in the Spatial Editor.&nbsp; You are only able to reverse the very last
operation.&nbsp; You can undo the last Undo.</li>
  <li>Legends -- Brings up a cascade menu allowing you to hide the
legends,
show
the map legends, show all fcst legends, show just the active fcst
legend,
or show all weather element legends.</li>
  <li> <a name="SelectHomogeneous"></a>Select Homogeneous Area --
Selects
an edit
area of grid points whose values are within the weather element's Fuzz
Value of the point at which MB3 was pressed. For example, suppose the
Fuzz
Value for T is 5 degrees and you press MB3 over a grid point that has a
value of 60 degrees. The edit area selected will consist of those
points
that are contiguous with the point at which you pressed and have values
between 50 and 70 degrees. Homogenous areas for WEATHER and DISCRETE
type
data consist of those areas that contain the same data value.</li>
  <li>Deselect Contiguous Area -- Deselect the polygon of the active
edit
area
which includes the point at which MB3 was pressed. For example, if the
current edit area consists of two disjoint polygons and you press MB3
over
one of them, it will disappear from the active edit area. This
operation
alters the active edit area.</li>
  <li>Set Fuzz Value -- Brings up the <a
 href="SpatialEditorDialogs.html#FuzzValueDialog">Set
Fuzz Value Dialog</a> which allows the user to set the fuzz value that
applies to selecting homogeneous areas. Applies only to SCALAR
and
VECTOR.</li>
  <li>Vector Edit Mode -- Allows user to switch the vector edit mode
between
Magnitude Only, Direction Only, or Both components.&nbsp; Available
only
when a Vector weather element is the active element.</li>
  <li>Weather Edit Mode -- Allows user to switch the weather edit mode
between
Combine and Replace modes. Available only when a Weather weather
element is the active element.</li>
  <li>Add ISC Marker -- Available when an ISC grid is directly
displayed (clicking on the ISC grid). Adds an marker
(similar
to a sample, but without the data value display) at the popup location.
Markers are used to indicate the ISC update time, site identifier, and
official database symbol. Refer to the <a href="ISC.html">Intersite
Coordination
User's Guide</a> for more details on markers. Depending
upon the office type of the ISC grid, this adds the ISC marker to the
appropriate marker set.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Remove ISC Marker -- Available when an ISC grid is directly
displayed (clicking on the ISC grid) and when near an
existing
marker. Removes an marker (similar to a sample, but without the data
value
display) near the popup location. Refer to the <a href="ISC.html">Intersite
Coordination User's Guide</a> for more details on markers.
Depending upon the office type of the ISC grid, this removes the ISC
marker from the appropriate marker set.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Zoom to -- Change the X-direction of the Spatial Editor display
to one
of the several distances.</li>

  <li>Change Graphic Color to -- Changes the graphic color of the
Weather
Element
or Map to the color you select. When you change the graphic color
of a Weather Element, both its graphic display color and its Legend
color
are changed accordingly. Also provides access to the <a
 href="ColorDialogs.html#ColorChooser">Color
Chooser</a>.</li>
  <li>Line Width -- Changes the width of the lines that make up the
contour,
wind barb, wind arrow, or weather area.</li>
  <li>Line Style -- Changes the texture of the line. Choices are:
SOLID,
DASHED, DOTTED, and DASH_DOTTED.</li>
  <li>Density -- Changes the contour interval if the weather element is
displayed
as a graphic, much like the D2D system.</li>
  <li>Magnification -- Changes the size of the contour labels for the
selected
weather element, the size of the wind barbs, or the label sizes for the
map backgrounds.</li>
  <li>Unload -- Unloads the Weather Element or Map from the GFE -- the
Legend
of the Weather Element and its display in the Spatial Editor are both
removed.</li>
  <li>Display As Image or Display As Graphic</li>
  <li>Display Attributes -- The <a href="#SEDisplayAttributes">Spatial
Editor
Display Attributes Dialog</a> appears.</li>
  <li>Grid Ops -- Opens a cascade menu allowing you to do many of the

operations apply to the weather element and grid identified by the
legend:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Delete Grid -- Deletes the current grid.</li>
  <li>Create From Scratch -- Creates a grid from scratch.</li>
  <li>Delete Grid -- Remove the grid.</li>
  <li>Fragment Grid -- Divide the grid into the smallest duration
possible.
For
example, a 12 hour temperature grid may be divided into 12 hourly grids.</li>
  <li>Assign Default Value -- Resets the data in the grid to a default
value.
For WEATHER type grids, the default is no weather. For VECTOR type
grids,
the default is zero magnitude. For SCALAR type grids, the default is
the
weather element's minimum possible value as defined in <a
 href="serverConfig.html#serverConfig.py">serverConfig.py</a>
.&nbsp; For DISCRETE type grids, the default is the first definition
for
the discrete key in the weather element definition in <a
 href="serverConfig.html">serverConfig.py</a>.
The menu label indicates the default value, e.g., "Assign &lt;NoWx&gt;".</li>
  <li>Assign PickUp Value -- Sets the data in the grid to the current
pickup
value, while ignoring the vector edit mode and weather combine modes.
The
menu label indicates the current pickup value, e.g., "Assign 45".</li>
