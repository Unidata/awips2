Numpy is an extension to Python that provides the capability
of operating on grids easily and efficiently. The syntax for
Numpy is fully explained in the <a href="http://www.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial">Numpy
Tutorial</a>. In this section, we will explain the basic concepts
that are relevant to the GFESuite.&nbsp; To access the Numpy
library, include the following statement in your Python module:
<p>from numpy import *
<h2 align=center>
<a NAME="NumericArrays"></a>Numeric Arrays</h2>
The basic data structure for Numpy is a Numeric Array.
The array objects are generally homogeneous collections of potentially
large volumes of numbers. All numbers in a array are the same kind (i.e.
number representation, such as double-precision floating point). Array
objects must be full (no empty cells are allowed), and their size is immutable.
The specific numbers within them can change throughout the life of the
array. Here is an example of Python code using the array objects (italicized
text refers to user input, non-italicized text to computer output):
<p>> python
<br>>>> <i>from numpy import *</i>
<br>>>> <i>vector1 = array((1,2,3,4,5))</i>
<br>>>> <i>print vector1</i>
<p>[1 2 3 4 5]
<p>>>> <i>matrix1 = array(([0,1],[1,3]))</i>
<br>>>> <i>print matrix1</i>
<p>[[0 1]
<p>[1 3]]
<p>>>> <i>print vector1.shape, matrix1.shape</i>
<p>(5,) (2,2)
<p># Note the "shape" is the dimensions of the array
<p>>>> <i>print vector1 + vector1</i>
<p>[ 2 4 6 8 10]]
<p>>>> <i>print matrix1 * matrix1</i>
<p>[[0 1]
<p>[1 9]]
<p># Note that this is not the matrix multiplication of linear algebra


<h2 align=center>
<a NAME="Grids"></a>Grids</h2>
GFESuite extensions such as Smart Tools and Smart Initialization provide
access to grid data via 2-dimensional Numpy arrays. The
naming of these grids and the methods of access may differ, but the concepts
and operations on the underlying Numpy arrays is the same.
<h2 align=center>
<a NAME="BasicArithmeticOperations"></a>Basic Arithmetic Operations</h2>
Basic arithmetic operations are very easy in Numpy and operate
on entire grids at once. When operating on grids, we ensure that
the grids are all the same size in the x and y dimensions. Any D2D or IFP
data that you access is assured to have the same grid sizes.
If you have two grids, called grid1 and grid2 and you want to make a difference
grid and store it into grid3, then the syntax is:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grid3 = grid1 - grid2
<p>If you want to add a constant value to a grid, then the syntax is like
this:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grid = grid + 5.0
<p>Converting a grid from degrees Kelvin to degrees Fahrenheit is as simple
as:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gridF = (gridK - 273.15)
* 9/5 + 32
<p>In general, do not use loops to index through points in the grid.
Performance will suffer greatly. Normally you access the entire grid
at a time, using the above syntax. The operation you specify will be applied to EVERY grid
point in the grid.
<p>To initialize a grid, GFESuite extensions provide an empty array (set
to zeros) guaranteed to be of the correct dimensions.&nbsp; The empty array
is called "self._empty". To initialize a grid to a particular value,
say 3.0:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; grid = self._empty + 3.0
<p><b>Note:</b>&nbsp; self._empty is not available in Python in general.
It is specific to GFESuite extensions such as Smart Tools and Smart Initialization
which have knowledge of the appropriate grid dimensions for your domain.
<h2 align=center>
<a NAME="LogicalStatementsandMasks"></a>Logical Statements and Masks</h2>
Logical statements are used to compare grid values. The result from
a logical statement is typically a "boolean" grid, which is a grid that
has either 1 (true) or 0 (false) values.&nbsp; These grids are sometimes
called "masks" and are used with conditional statements. Each logical
statement requires two arguments, the first being the grid,
and the second being the numerical value for comparison (or even another
grid). Here is a subset of statements that you may find useful:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; less(),&nbsp; equal(),&nbsp;
not_equal(),&nbsp; greater(),&nbsp; greater_equal(),&nbsp; less_equal()
<p>For example, to create a mask called bgrid, which represents whether
grid points of temperatures are greater than 50 degrees, the statement
would be:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bgrid = greater(tGrid, 50)
<h2 align=center>
<a NAME="ComplexLogicalStatements"></a>Complex Logical Statements</h2>
Sometimes you need a mask that has two logical statements. You can
use the logical_and() and logical_or() statements to combine logical statements.
Each of these statements require two arguments, which are the ones that
are going to combine with "and" or "or".
<p>For example, to create a mask called bgrid, which represents grid points
from temperatures that are between 40 and 60, you could use a statement
like this:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bgrid = logical_and(greater_equal(tGrid,
40), less_equal(tGrid, 60))
<p>To create a mask which represents the grid points from temperatures
that are below 40 or above 60:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bgrid = logical_or(less(tGrid,
40), greater(tGrid, 60))
<h2 align=center>
<a NAME="ConditionalStatements-thewherestatement"></a>Conditional Statements
- the "where" statement</h2>
Normally a logical statement isn't too useful by itself, and you want to
assign a value to a grid based on whether a conditional is true or false.
The <i>where</i>
statement is similar to a if...else... statement in C++ or Python.
The <i>where</i> statement takes three arguments: the first is the
logical statement, the second is the
value to be assigned to the grid if the logical statement is true,
and the third is the value to be assigned to the output if the logical
statement is false.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where(conditional statement,
assignment if true, assignment if false)
<p>For example,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; snowGrid = where(less(tGrid,
32), 10.0*QPF,&nbsp; 0.0))
<p>takes the tGrid and compares it to 32 degrees. This results in
a temporary boolean grid which has grid points that are set to true if
the temperature is less than 32 and
false if the temperature is greater to or equal to 32.
The calculated snow grid is based on the boolean grid and the QPF grid.
If the temperature is equal or above
32, then the "false"assignment is done, thus assigning zero to the
snowGrid. If the temperature is below 32, then the "true" assignment
is performed
and the snowGrid is set to 10 times the value of the QPF grid.
<h2 align=center>
<a NAME="ClippingorLimitingthevaluesofaGrid"></a>Clipping (or Limiting)
the values of a Grid</h2>
Many output grids need to be clipped or limited to a range of values.
For example, if you calculate a QPF that is modified based on upslope and
downslope and the
calculation results in a negative QPF, you know that you need to change
it to 0.0 (since negative QPFs are not allowed). The "clip" function
takes three arguments:
the input grid, the minimum value, and the maximum value.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finalQPF = clip(calcQPF,
0.0, 10.0)
<h2 align=center>
<a NAME="Cubes"></a>Cubes</h2>
While the GFESuite Forecast grids represent surface weather elements, D2D
model grids often represent weather elements at various atmospheric levels.
In Numerical Python, we can represent this data as 3-dimensional arrays,
or cubes. When examining weather element cubes, we often
have a cube of geopotential height available to map between pressure levels
and elevation.
<p><img SRC="images/SmartTools-8.jpg" height=719 width=959>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Note the naming convention we use for cube variables: <i>wxElement_c</i>
where <i>_c</i> indicates a cube.
<h2 align=center>
<a NAME="AccessingPartsofGridsandCubes"></a>Accessing Parts of Grids and
Cubes</h2>
The syntax for accessing individual rows or columns in a grid is similar
to accessing portions of a list in Python, using the bracket and colon
syntax. For example:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; print grid[25][45]
<p>will print the value of the grid at the 45th column of the 25th row.
<p>Refer to the Numerical Python documentation for more details.
For cubes, you can access any individual level using indexing, or
multiple levels using more complicated indexing. For example, if
you have an relative humidity cube of 6 levels, and you want just the 2nd
level (remember Python counts from 0), you would use this syntax:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rh_c[1]
<p>If you wanted a cube that only had the 2nd through 4th levels, then
the syntax would be:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rh_c[1:3]
<h2 align=center>
<a NAME="LookingUpAColumnofaCube"></a>Looking Up the Columns of a Cube</h2>
Some of your algorithms will want to "look up the columns" of a cube and
then stop when certain critera has been reached. An example of this
is the calculation of freezing level.&nbsp; We want to start at the surface
and go up until we reach the point where the temperature is below freezing.
Then we interpolate between that level and the previous level to find the
"real" freezing level.
<p>The following function (from Smart Initialization) accesses the cubes
of geopotential heights and temperatures.&nbsp; The true surface topography
grid is also accessed:
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def calcFzLevel(self,&nbsp; gh_c,&nbsp; t_c,&nbsp;
topo):
<p>We start with a grid that contains -1.&nbsp; The&nbsp; self._minus variable
is a 2-D grid of -1s. During the calculation up the column, the grid
will contain -1 if the freezing level has
not yet been reached, or the actual freezing level if the level has
been reached. We make the assumption that the freezing level can
never be -1 (since that is below sea level).
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fzl = self._minus
<p>The <b>for</b> loop "i" goes from 0 to the size of the z dimension of&nbsp;
the cube of gh.&nbsp; The 0 represents the 'z' dimension.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for i in xrange(gh_c.shape[0]):
<p>We use a try/except block to "catch" the failure on the first iteration
of the <b>for</b> loop. The exception is caused by accessing the
"i-1"th level which is illegal when i == 0.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; try:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
# Interpolate between cube levels
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
val = gh_c[i-1] + (gh_c[i] - gh_c[i-1]) / (t_c[i] - t_c[i-1])&nbsp; * (273.15
- t_c[i-1])
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
except:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
# Handle the first level
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
val = gh_c[i]
<p>After we have calculated "val", which is a 2-D grid, representing the
freezing level height based on the two temperatures and two gh values at
each layer, then we apply it only in certain cases. The following statement only
assigns the calculated freezing level if it already hasn't been assigned,
and the actual temperature of the layer is less than freezing.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fzl
= where(logical_and(equal(fzl, -1),&nbsp; less_equal(t_c[i], 273.15)),
val,&nbsp; fzl)
<p>The following simply converts the meters to feet.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fzl
= fzl * 0.3048
<p>And the grid is returned.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return
fzl
<br>
<h2 align=center>
<a NAME="Reducing"></a>Reducing</h2>
The concept of "reducing" is a numpy concept of taking a multi-dimensional
grid (or cube) and reducing its dimensions. Another concept is flattening
the grid. For example, take all of the relative humidities from the
surface to a fixed millibar level and average them. You start with
a cube of rh and end up with a 2-D grid of average rh. This example
calculates the probability of precipitation based on the Fcst QPF,
and the geopotential heights and relative humidity cubes.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; def calcPoP(self, gh_c, rh_c, QPF, topo):</tt>
<p>The first few lines take the gh and rh cubes and only use the first
8 levels.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; # only use the first
8 levels (up to MB600)</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gh_c = gh_c[:8,:,:]</tt>
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rh_c = rh_c[:8,:,:]</tt>
<p>The less statement creates a 3-D mask based on the gh levels and the
topography levels.&nbsp; The mask is 1 where the gh level is less than
the topography and 0 where the gh level is greater or equal to the topography.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mask = less(gh_c, topo)</tt>
<p>Wherever there is a 1 in the mask, rh_avg gets a 0.&nbsp; Wherever there
was a 0 in the mask, rh_avg gets the value in the rh_c.&nbsp; The rh_avg
is still a cube with 0 below the surface.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rh_avg = where(mask,
0, rh_c)</tt>
<p>We need a count grid since we have to compute an average. The count
is actually a cube that has a 0 if the rh_avg is 0 or less, and a 1 if
the rh_avg is greater than 0.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; count = where(greater(rh_avg,
0), 1, 0)</tt>
<p>The add.reduce() sums up along the z-axis (the 0 indicates the z-direction,
1 the x-direction, 2 the y-direction), and returns a single number that
is the sum in each column.&nbsp; It turns the 3-D cube into a 2-D grid.&nbsp;
Count is a 2-D grid.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; count = add.reduce(count,
0)</tt>
<p>The add.reduce() sums up the rh grids in the column above the surface.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rh_avg = add.reduce(rh_avg,
0)</tt>
<p>The real average relative humidity is calculated in this next compound
statement. The average relative humidity is the rh_avg/count.
We do some extra work to ensure that the count is not zero by adding 0.001
to the count.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dpop = rh_avg / (count
+ .001) - 70.0</tt>
<p>We force dpop to be within the range -30 to 30%.
<p><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dpop = clip(dpop, -30,
30)</tt>
<p>Finally we calculate the primary pop. If QPF &lt; 0.02, then the
pop is 1000 * QPF. Otherwise set QPF to 350*QPF + 13.
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pop = where(less(QPF,
0.02), QPF * 1000, QPF * 350 + 13)</tt>
<p>We add in the delta pop.
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pop = pop + dpop</tt>
<p>We make sure the range is between 0 and 100%
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pop = clip(pop, 0, 100)</tt>
<p>And return the answer.
<br><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; return pop</tt>
