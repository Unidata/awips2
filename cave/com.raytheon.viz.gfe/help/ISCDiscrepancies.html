<h2 class="1Heading"><a name="Discrepancies"></a>Identifying Intersite
Discrepancies</h2>
The following procedure and tools allow the forecaster to view
discrepancies
between the local forecast and those from other sites. It is important
to note that this method is presented only as a beginning to this
complex
problem and is offered not as a solution, but, rather, as a way to
begin
the conversation between developers and forecasters about how to
utilize
our computer power to accomplish intersite coordination. The exercises
will familiarize you with the procedure and tools and show you how to
run
them. We hope that this will serve as a launching point for feedback
and
brainstorming.
<p>In order to perform these exercises, you should have familiarity
with
creating and running Smart Tools and Procedures. See the <a
 href="SmartTools.html">Smart
Tools Training Guide.<!-- Leave this comment for formatting purposes -->

<a name="Ex1"></a>Exercise Discrepancy-1 -- Examining the "Swath" Edit
Area</h4>
<div class="Body">In this exercise, we will examine the "swath" edit
area
set up by the server around the CWA. You can think of a "swath" as a
doughnut-shaped
object around the border of the CWA/Marine Zones. This is the area in
which
we will be checking for discrepancies.</div>
<ol>
  <div class="Body"><li>Select Main Menu--&gt;Edit
Areas--&gt;ISC--&gt;ISC_Tool_Area.</li>
  <li>Make sure the automatically generated area is satisfactory to
you. If
you
want to make minor modifications, do so, and then re-save the area
under
the same name, "ISC_Tool_Area."</li>
  </div>

Make

<h3 class="2Heading"><a name="Tools"></a>Intersite Coordination Tools</h3>
There are four tools to help identify discrepancies:
<ol>
  <li>Show_ISC_Highlights -- highlights grids that are discrepant. This
is
the
tool called by the ISC_Discrepancies Procedure.</li>
  <li>Show_ISC_Grid -- creates a discrepancy grid to be viewed from the
Grid
Manager.</li>
  <li>Show_ISC_Area -- creates an edit area identifying where
discrepancies
were
found.</li>
  <li>Show_ISC_Info -- creates a dialog containing information about
each segment (e.g., border) and how "discrepant" each border is.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
Note: These tools are baselined versions of <a href="ShowISC.html">Tim
Barker's (BOI SOO) set
of ISC tools</a>.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
These tools can be run as any other smart tool. In addition, they are
automatically added to the Grid Manager popup menu and thus are easily
accessible.<br>
<h4 class="3Heading"><a name="Ex3"></a>Exercise Discrepancy-3 --
Running the ISC Tools.</h4>
<ol>
  <li>From a grid in the Grid Manager, select
B3--&gt;Show_ISC_Highlights. If
discrepancies
are found, the grid will be highlighted in red. When you have found a
grid
with discrepancies, run the B3--&gt;Show_ISC_Area tool. This will
display
an edit area in which discrepancies were found.</li>
  <li>Run the B3--&gt;Show_ISC_Grid tool. This will display a grid of
the
discrepancy
values. The new weather element that was created is a temporary
element.
It will appear in the Spatial Editor legend as well as the Weather
Element
Browser. However, it is not saved in the server, so if you unload it or
shut-down the GFE, it will be gone. Try unloading the temporary element
from the legend.</li>
  <li>You can clear the highlight on the grid by selecting
B3--&gt;Clear
Highlight.</li>
  <li>Run the B3--&gt;Show_ISC_Info tool. This will display a dialog
containing statistics about each border.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
This is the ISC grid that we will examine using the ISC tools.&nbsp;
Note that the BOU CWA temperatures are higher than the adjacent CYS and
GLD temperatures:

tool.
It highlights those locations in the isc swath where discrepancies were
found:

<h3><a name="ModifyingIntersiteCoordinationProcedureandTools"></a>Modifying
Intersite Coordination Procedure and Tools</h3>
The Intersite Coordination Procedure and Tools are based on the
ISC_Utility
and the ISC_Utility_Local files which can be found in the Edit Action
Dialog
Utilities window. You can override the default settings in the
ISC_Utility_Local
file. Do not change the ISC_Utility file itself as this may be
updated
in future releases. For more information on Utilities, see the <a
 href="SmartTools.html#Util">Smart
Tool Training Guide Utilities Section.</a>
The ISC_Utility_Local file allows you to override various items within
the ISC_Utility file. See the documentation in these files for more
information.<br>
