/**
 * Abstract base class for objects which are used to contain math algorithms to
 * make one interpolated grid of data. This manages the data common to its
 * derived classes. Interp derived classes have the following responsibilities:
 * examine the sequence of grid slices and determine which require
 * interpolation; interpolate one grid at a time upon command from the
 * Interpolator.
 * 
 * Interpolation is based on a set of grid slices and time ranges. Some come
 * with defined data, called the "base" grid slices. This data is used to
 * control interpolation. Others have no grid data in them yet but they do have
 * start and end times defined. The missing grid data will be generated here by
 * interpolation and put into the missing grids. Only one grid is interpolated
 * at a time, on the call to the interpolate function.
