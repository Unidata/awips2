#
#  When looking for grids that are "in" a particular day, we need to
#  be careful about 'long' grids, like MaxT or MinT.  For example, in
#  some timezones, a "UTC day" will have the end of one MaxT grid, then
#  a blank time, and then the start of another MaxT grid.  Which one is
#  the "one" for that particular day?  The OFFSET hours are added to the 
#  start and end of a UTC day - and then grids are checked to see if they
#  intersect this new 'time period' for the day.
#
#  For example, in the mountain timezone, a MaxT grid starts at 14Z and 
#  lasts through 02Z the next UTC day.  When looking at grids for, say,
#  Oct 3rd, we don't want to consider the one that crosses over the first
#  2 hours of the UTC day - we want only the one that intersects the "end"
#  of the day.  So...we set the START_OFFSET_HOURS for "MaxT" to 12.  Only
#  grids that cross over the 12Z to 00Z 'end' of the day will be considered
#  for 'that day'.
#
#  Likewise, some definitions of MaxRH in the mountain timezone go from
#  22Z on one day, through 16Z on the next day (although there is no
#  'standard' for period definitions for MaxRH/MinRH).  We want the MaxRH
#  for a particular day, to be the one that covers the period from 00Z to
#  16Z, not the 2 hours of the next one that starts at 22Z late in the day.
#  So...we set the END_OFFSET_HOURS for MaxRH to -12.  The 'end' of the day
#  is now 12Z, so only grids that intersect the 00Z to 12Z period are
#  considered for that day.
#
#  For parms NOT listed here - the offset is zero - which is the normal
#  situation for parms that don't cover a time period.

#
#  BASE_OFFSET is used when figuring out common cases.  For any model
#  listed here, we add the specified number of hours to it's real basetime
#  to get it's "effective" basetime, and compare that to other models
#  when finding common cases.  For example, if we have "SREF":-3, here
#  then for a 15Z run of the SREF model - we will add -3 hours to that,
#  getting 12Z - and check for other 12Z models when finding common cases.
