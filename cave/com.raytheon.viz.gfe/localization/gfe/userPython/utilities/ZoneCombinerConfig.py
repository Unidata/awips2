# database. The map file name from the config file has the CWA removed and is
# converted to uppercase.
# For example, if the old entry was mapNameForCombinations = 'FireWxZones_OAX',
# then the FIREWXZONES entry in tables would be used to obtain the name of the
# database table.

# SQL definitions of the additional data columns (other than the zone geometry) needed for
# ZoneCombinerComp.java to manipulate the onscreen map. Dictionary keys are the
# database table names, values are a list of strings with the SQL for the fields.
# Generally speaking, these entries should be left alone, but changes to the
# database might require modifications.
# In the current implementation, a single database query using UNION clauses is performed to
# obtain the map. Therefore, the column definitions for all the tables must be union-compatible.

# value cannot be interpreted as a number, or the point is outside the scrollable map, an error message
# will be generated and the values will be ignored.

# up to the nearest value on the zoom menu, or to "x8" if the value is above 8.
