# WORKING WITH UGLY STRINGS
#
# Although methods are provided (below) for working with Wx values,
# they are prohibitively slow and we recommend working directly with
# the "ugly" Wx string.  See the SmartTools User Guide for more
# information as well as the examples/smartTools directory.

# CREATING WEATHER STRINGS
#
# To create a weather string use this method:
#   WxString(description)
#     where description is a text string with the parts of a weather
#     value in order:
#         coverage,
#         types(can be single or a list),
#         intensity,
#         visibility,
#         attr
#     the parts are separated by spaces
# Example:
#   Wx = WxString("Sct RW")
#   Wx = WxString("Sct RW -")
#
# If you want to append multiple weather strings together you must
# put a "^" in between them.
# Example:
#   Wx = WxString("Sct RW") + "^" + WxString("Ocnl S")
#
# WARNING:  If you recieve an error indicating there was an invalid weather
#   string, make sure you have requested a valid combination of weather
#   coverages, types, intensities, etc.  For example, only certain intensities
#   are allowed with certain types and the system will not accept invalid
#   combinations.  This information is specified in the Configuration for
#   Weather (serverConfig.py).

def WxString(description):
    # Return a string with the designated arguments

    #print "WxString desc ", description
    coverage, wxType, inten, vis, attr = \
               convertWxDescription(description)
    #print "WxString convert ", coverages, wxTypes, intens, vis, attrs


    # Handle wildcards
    if coverage == "*":
        coverage = "<NoCov>"
    if wxType == "*":

# EXAMINING WEATHER STRINGS
#
# To examine a Weather value, use the methods
#
#    WxContains(WeatherValue, description)
#      Returns true if the weather value contains the arguments of
#      of the description which is a textstring with arguments
#      separated by spaces and can contain wildcards (*) and lists
#    Examples:
#      WxContains(Wx, "Sct RW")

#           intensity, visibility or attributes
#      WxContains(Wx, "* RW")

#           or attributes
#
#    WxContainsExact(WeatherValue, exactComponent)
#      This is a less powerful, but faster method if you are only
#      looking for one certain coverage, type, intensity, attribute,
#      or visibility
#    Examples:
#      WxContainsExact(Wx, "Sct")
#      WxContainsExact(Wx, "RW")

# MODIFYING WEATHER STRINGS
