# SnowAmt_fm_SnowRatio_and_QPF
#
# Author: Brian Meade, GRR, 12/07
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# short tool which simply computes SnowAmt by multiplying SnowRatio times QPF.
# SnowRatio is a local grid which is created by a smartInit which applies
# the Cobb Snow Algoritm
