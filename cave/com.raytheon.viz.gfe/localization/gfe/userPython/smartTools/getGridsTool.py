# getGridsTool - generic smart tool to use the SmartScript class getGrids 
#            method to get the max, sum, etc. value of all grids of the
#            element defined by varDict["Element"] into the active element.
#            The active element should span multiple grids of
#            varDict["Element"]. This tool is designed to be
#            called by a procedure and not run interactively.
#            This is a more generic version of getSumGrids and getMaxGrid
#            SmartTools and could be used to replace these tools by adding
#            varDict["Mode"] = "method" to the calling procedure. Method
#            is any value accepted by the "mode" argument to getGrids plus
#            "Last" to get the last grid and "MaxTime" to get the grid with
#            the largest percentage time coverage.
