# serpFile - version 2.0
#
#    Does the equivalent of the plain 'serp' tool - but gets the location
#    and control point information from a file.  Thus, this tool needs no
#    user input and can be run as part of a cronjob, etc.
#
#    The file is a comma delimited file where each data line contains a
#    station ID (ignored), a latitude, a longitude, and a data value.
#    Typical data lines might look like this:
#
#    BOI,43.57,-116.22,50.5
#    TWF,42.48,-114.48,43 # comment about this line
#
#    To make the file more readable, you can have comment lines which
#    start with a # character or are simply whitespace.
#
#    Any lines with less than 4 comma delimited values are ignored.  Lines
#    with more than 4 comma delimited values are potentially used - but
#    fields after the first 4 are ignored. 
#
#    Stations located off the GFE grid are ignored.  
#
#    Multiple sites lying on the same GFE gridpoint  are ignored (only 
#    the first one is used - and a status bar message is produced 
#    which tells you that the second (or more) station is being ignored).
#
#    No timeRange checking is done - the tool simply operates on the
#    current grid, using the values supplied in the file and stores the
#    results back into the same grid.  Clipping is performed so that the
#    values of the new grid do not exceed the allowable values for the
#    grid.
#
#    This works for SCALAR grids only - not vectors or weather/discrete 
#    elements
#
# Author: Tim Barker - SOO BOI (serp tool is from Les Colin)
#   2014/06/11 - Modified a couple of things to make it cleaner in A2
#   2010/08/05 - updated to use ObjAnal utility
#   2003/10/16 - original implementation based on serp tool

FILENAME="/tmp/lsrinfo.dat"
#
#  If you wish to include elevation adjustment (so that adjustments
#  are based on elevation differences as well as horizontal distance
#  from the point) then set elevation_factor to a non-zero value.
#
#  elevation_factor should be in units of feet/km.
#
#  If you set it to 1, then 1 foot of elevation difference is
#  equivalent to 1km of horizontal distance (this means
#  that elevation is VERY important in the analysis).
#
#  if you set it to 1000, then 1000 feet of elevation
#  difference is equal to 1 km of horizontal distance
#  (this means that elevation is NOT important to the
#  analysis).  
#
#  To turn off elevation completely - set the elevation_factor to zero.
#  which is the default  
#
#  A value of 36 feet/km seems work reasonably well for including SOME
#  influence of elevation - but not too much.

elevation_factor=0.0
