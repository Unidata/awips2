# Show_ISC_Info - Version 3.04 (Tim Barker - SOO Boise, ID)
#
#   creates a Tk window where it shows information on the ISC discrepancy
#   stats for each of the surrounding CWAs (the list of CWAs is controlled
#   by the config information in the ISC_Utility_Local).  For each CWA it
#   gives the average discrepancy, the average threshold, the number of
#   points considered (some border pairs ignored because of topography
#   differences, ocean/land difference, or failure to meet conditional
#   criteria like wind speeds above 12 kts, etc.), number of individual
#   points that failed, and a colored highlight for whether that border
#   passed or failed.
#
#   Optionally can have it check multiple parameters when run on certain
#   grids.  By default, when you run it on RH grids, it checks T and Td
#   grids too.
#
# 2006-01-23 - Barker - Version 3.04. Added thresholds for more parameters
# 2006-01-19 - Barker - Version 3.03. Fixed another problm in ISC_Utility
#              for non-square GFE domains.
# 2006-01-17 - Barker - Version 3.02. Fixed problem in ISC_Utility for
#              non-square GFE domains.
# 2006-01-13 - Barker - Version 3.01. Changed for new NDFD algorithm.
#              Thresholds now vary at each gridpoint - overall average
#              difference along border must be less than average threshold
#              along that border (a much better algorithm!). All
#              calculations done in ISC Utility routine. Text summary of
#              borders is displayed in format similar to old tool - but
#              different because of new agorithm.
# 2004-11-17 - Mathewson - baselined at FSL
# 2004-10-31 - Version 2.4.  Remove by-length calculations. Fix error in
#              sky threshold.  Fix Status Bar messages for IFPS 16. Fix
#              accumulative elements.
# 2004-10-12 - Version 2.3.  Remove restriction that ISC grids must be
#              displayed (not needed in IFPS 15 or 16).  Cuts down on number
#              of cached grids it stores and increases time between
#              recomputes of cached grids
# 2004-09-30 - Version 2.2. Changes to ISC_Utility_Local for handling
#              specified edit areas (which can include marine) rather than
#              edit areas based only on CWA name.  Thresholds changed
#              extensively to add thresholds based on grid values.  Code
#              to eliminate border pairs with large elevation differences
#              changed to more reasonable code, since NDFD fixed their code.
#              Changed to show if the average discrepancy would violate
#              the 'by length' weighted average threshold (as NDFD does).
# 2004-09-05 - Version 2.1. Changes to ISC_Utility_Local for
#              handling areas where no neighbor exists.
# 2004-08-15 - Version 2.0 - Thresholds are not hard-coded and derived from
#              average elevation difference - like in NDFD (but still
#              WRONG (in my opinion).
# 2004-06-20 - version 1.1 - Various changes to vector checks to be somewhat
#              closer to NDFD checks - though NDFD is in a state of flux
# 2004-06-08 - version 1.0 - Added multi-parameter tests, and the
#              handling of vector parms
# 2004-02-11 - Cleaned up old tool used in BOI for quite some time.
