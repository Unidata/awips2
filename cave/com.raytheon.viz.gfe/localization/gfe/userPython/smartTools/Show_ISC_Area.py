# Show_ISC_Area - Version 3.04 (Tim Barker - SOO Boise, ID)
#
#   Creates an edit area containing points in your CWA that when compared
#   to a neighbors ISC grids, violate the discrepancy criteria for this
#   parameter and point.
#
# Author: hansen
#  2006-01-23 - Barker - Version 3.04. Added thresholds for more parameters
#  2006-01-19 - Barker - Version 3.03. Fixed another problm in ISC_Utility
#               for non-square GFE domains.
#  2006-01-17 - Barker - Version 3.02. Fixed problem in ISC_Utility for
#               non-square GFE domains.
#  2006-01-13 - Barker - Version 3.01. Changed for new NDFD algorithm.
#               Thresholds now vary at each gridpoint - overall average
#               difference along border must be less than average threshold
#               along that border (a much better algorithm!). All
#               calculations done in ISC Utility routine.
#  2004-11-17   Mathewson - Baselined
#  2004-10-31 - Version 2.4.  Remove by-length calculations. Fix error in
#               sky threshold.  Fix Status Bar messages for IFPS 16. Fix
#               accumulative elements.
#  2004-10-12 - Version 2.3.  Remove restriction that ISC grids must be
#               displayed (not needed in IFPS 15 or 16).  Cuts down on number
#               of cached grids it stores and increases time between
#               recomputes of cached grids
#  2004-09-30 - Version 2.2. Changes to ISC_Utility_Local for handling
#               specified edit areas (which can include marine) rather than
#               edit areas based only on CWA name.  Thresholds changed
#               extensively to add thresholds based on grid values.  Code
#               to eliminate border pairs with large elevation differences
#               changed to more reasonable code, since NDFD fixed their code.
#  2004-09-05 - Version 2.1. Changes to ISC_Utility_Local for
#               handling areas where no neighbor exists.
#  2004-08-15 - Version 2.0. Threshold is now different for each neighbor CWA
#               and based on the average elevation difference of the points
#               inside our CWA that border this neighbor CWA - and for which
#               ISC data is available and at least one of the border points
#               meet any criteria-based test (like wind speed), and do not
#               have too great an average elevation difference to be eliminated.
#               Thgis is what NDFD does. (Clear as mud...huh?)
#  2004-06-20 - Version 1.1. Modified to use modified ISC_Utility_Local
#               routines so that discrepancies are identical (close) to NDFD
