# BUF_WxTool - Version 2.1
#
# Author: John Rozbicki NWS BUF
# Date Last Modified: 08/25/08
#
# History of Changes:
#
# Version 2.1 (08/25/08) - Made the following changes:
#
#                          (1) Added code so that the tool just produces a single pop-up error message if
#                              thunderstorms (T) or severe thunderstorms (T+) are selected, along with
#                              multiple invalid thunderstorm attributes. Previously, the tool would generate
#                              an error message for each invalid attribute.
#
#                          (2) Added new checks to allow the tool to run to completion if the user selects:
#
#                              (a) Areal coverage qualifiers; and
#                              (b) A weather type of R, S, ZR, IP, L, or ZL; and
#                              (c) A valid alternate precipitation coverage.
#
#                              Previously, the tool would just ignore any alternate precipitation coverages,
#                              and return a pop-up error message if just conditions (a) and (b) were met. Now,
#                              the alternate precipitation coverage is also checked - an error message is returned
#                              only if conditions (a) and (b) are met and a valid alternate coverage is NOT
#                              selected.
#
#                          (3) Changed the error message returned when the user selects a coverage of "Iso",
#                              "Sct" or "Num" with a precip type of R, S, ZR, IP, L, or ZL. Previously, this
#                              message stated that all areal coverage qualifiers were not valid for these weather
#                              types; this really isn't true. The change makes the output less confusing for the
#                              user.
#
#                          (4) Made some minor miscellaneous changes to the tool documentation and other
#                              pop-up error messages.
#
# Version 2.0 (03/27/06) - Made the following changes:
#
#                          (1) Added the ability to override the default probability/coverage
#                              obtained from the corresponding PoP grid if desired. This can be done
#                              separately for each individual weather type. This allows the easy creation
#                              of weather types such as "Lkly RW:Chc SW". This approach also allows for
#                              the use of other weather types (F, L, and ZL) which aren't necessarily PoP-
#                              dependent.
#
#                          (2) In conjunction with (1), added 3 new weather types (F, L, and ZL). Also
#                              added coverage terms ("Patchy", "Areas") which are specific to these elements.
#
#                          (3) Added very light (--) to the list of intensities. This makes in possible
#                              to assign weather types such as RW-- (sprinkles) and SW-- (flurries).
#
#                          (4) In conjunction with the 3 changes listed above, added the following internal
#                              checks to ensure that the tool does not create invalid weather types:
#
#                              (a) A check for the use of "Patchy" and "Areas" coverages with weather
#                                  types other than L, ZL, and F. (prevents invalid types such
#                                  as "Patchy R").
#
#                              (b) A check for the use of Areal Coverage qualifiers other than "Patchy",
#                                  "Areas", and "Wide" with L, ZL, and F (prevents invalid types such as
#                                  "Iso ZL").
#
#                              (c) A check for the use of very light, light, or moderate intensities with
#                                  F (none of which are valid).
#
#                              If the conditions in (a) or (b) are met, the tool will display a
#                              message indicating that the proposed weather type is invalid,
#                              and exits without modifying the Wx grid.
#
#                              If the condition in (c) is met, the tool will display a message indicating
#                              that the proposed intensity cannot be assigned to fog. It will also
#                              automatically change the intensity to <NoInten> without any further action
#                              on the part of the forecaster.
#
#                          (5) Added the ability to select alternate prob/cov terms (i.e., other than
#                              "Def" or "Wide") if categorical (>=74.5%) PoPs are used. In such cases,
#                              the following additional options are now available: "Ocnl", "Frq", "Brf",
#                              "Pds", and "Inter". When used, this setting will apply to all categorical
#                              precip coverages that are derived from the PoP grid.
#
#                          (6) Added the ability to specify an alternate probability/coverage
#                              for T if desired. This setting will override the default probability/
#                              coverage obtained from the corresponding PoP grid, and makes possible
#                              to create precip types such as "Def RW:Chc T".
#
#                          (7) Added an Tornadoes to the list of thunderstorm attributes. A check was also
#                              added to prevent the use of the Tornadoes attribute with non-severe
#                              thunderstorms.
#
#                          (8) Modified the tool to prevent the use of the SmA (small hail) and
#                              GW (gusty winds) thunderstorm attributes with severe thunderstorms (T+).
#
#                          (9) Modified the tool to now display a pop-up message if the user tries to
#                              select invalid thunderstorm attributes. If this occurs, the tool will still
#                              automatically ignore such attributes and run to completion as before.
#
#                          (10) Made the minimum PoP threshold for SChc weather site-configurable. This
#                               allows sites to tailor this setting to meet their individual needs. The
#                               default setting remains 14.5% - the Eastern Region standard.
#
#                          IMPORTANT: The above enhancements resulted in numerous changes to the tool GUI and
#                          the tool code. If you have previously customized the tool for your site,
#                          it is strongly recommended that you use the following procedure when upgrading:
#
#                          (1) Save off a copy of the existing BUF_WxTool under a different name.
#                          (2) Install Version 2.0 of the BUF_WxTool.
#                          (3) After installing Version 2.0, merge any local changes back into the tool
#                              (if needed).
# 
# Version 1.2 (02/23/05) - Updated for IFPS 16.2. Hail (A) is no longer a separate
#                          weather type in GFE, so removed separate handling of
#                          hail attributes from other thunderstorm attributes. This
#                          resulted in a simplification of the code, and the removal
#                          of all references to "hailstring". Also, fixed a potential
#                          bug which could result in "DmgW' not being assigned even if
#                          it was selected by the forecaster.
#
# Version 1.1 (03/21/03) - Changed the PoP thresholds to match the precision of the
#                          gridded data. For example, the threshold for Chc/Sct was
#                          25% before the change, with the change it's now 24.5%.
#
#                          The reason for the change: in Version 1.0, the tool would
#                          assign an incorrect Wx value for PoP values just below the
#                          thresholds; for example, "SChc" or "Iso" Wx would be
#                          assigned for PoPs in the 24.5%-24.9% range. With the change,
#                          the tool assigns the correct Wx for such PoP values - i.e.
#                          "Chc" or "Sct" Wx.
