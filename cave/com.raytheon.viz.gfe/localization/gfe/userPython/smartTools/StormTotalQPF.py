# StormTotalQPF
#
# This very simple tool will assign the sum of the qpf grids over the time range of 
# the StormTotalQPF grid. For example, if the user creates/stretches a StormTotalQPF
# grid which runs from 00z to 18z and runs this tool, the result will be the addition
# of the 00-06z, 06z-12z, and 12z-18z QPF grids.
