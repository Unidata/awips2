# RemoveWx - version 1.2 - Remove mention of any particular weather from any
#            combinations leaving everything else untouched.
#
# Author: Tim Barker - SOO Boise, ID
#    06/29/02 - Original Implementation
#    04/30/03 - version 1.1. Save weather Combine mode, force it to be
#               "Replace" while tool runs, then change it back to original
#               mode.  Otherwise - if mode is 'combine' when tool starts
#               nothing would happen.
#    03/20/05 - version 1.2. Remove weather codes that are no longer
#               available.  Better coding of string functions.
