## What is "self"????
##    "Self" refers to this Tool class instance.  Don't worry much about it.
##    All you need to do is:
##       -- Make sure to list "self" as the first argument of
##          method Definitions:
##              def myMethod(self, arg1, arg2)
##       -- When Calling your methods, use self.methodName omitting
##          "self" as the first argument:
##              x = self.myMethod(arg1, arg2)
##

## Error Handling
##   Call self.abort(errorString) to stop execution of your tool and
##     display a message to the user.
##   For example:
##     if x > 1000:
##        self.abort("x is too large")
##
##   Call self.noData(messageString) to stop execution of your tool
##     and return a "NoData" error which can be checked by a Script.
