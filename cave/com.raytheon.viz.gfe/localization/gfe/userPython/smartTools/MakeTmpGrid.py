# MakeTmpGrid - Creates a temporary grid of the active element. The new grid
#               has model name of "Temp" and element name of "tmp<WEname>"
#
# Author: Paul Jendrowski WFO Blacksburg, VA (RNK)
#         paul.jendrowski@noaa.gov
# Version: 3.0    Date: 11/08/2004
# Change History:
#    11/08/2004 - Added support for Wx and Vector grids.
#    07/17/2003 - Changed timeConstraints in call to createGrid for RPP21.a7
#                    values changed from hours to seconds
#                  Added logic to let calling procedure optionally specify
#                    name of new grid in argDict (backward compatible)
#    02/21/2003 - original version
