# Show_ISC_Highlights - Version 3.04 (Tim Barker - SOO Boise ID)
#
#   Highlight grid if it has a significant discrepancy with any of the ISC
#   neighbors.
#
# Author: hansen
# 2006-01-23 - Barker - Version 3.04. Added thresholds for more parameters
# 2006-01-19 - Barker - Version 3.03. Fixed another problm in ISC_Utility
#              for non-square GFE domains.
# 2006-01-17 - Barker - Version 3.02. Fixed problem in ISC_Utility for
#              non-square GFE domains.
# 2006-01-13 - Barker - Version 3.01. Changed for new NDFD algorithm.
#              Thresholds now vary at each gridpoint - overall average
#              difference along border must be less than average threshold
#              along that border (a much better algorithm!). All
#              calculations done in ISC Utility routine.
# 2004-11-17 - Mathewson - baselined by FSL
# 2004-10-31 - Version 2.4.  Remove by-length calculations. Fix error in
#              sky threshold.  Fix Status Bar messages for IFPS 16. Fix
#              accumulative elements.
# 2004-10-12 - Version 2.3.  Remove restriction that ISC grids must be
#              displayed (not needed in IFPS 15 or 16).  Cuts down on number
#              of cached grids it stores and increases time between
#              recomputes of cached grids
# 2004-09-30 - Version 2.2. Changes to ISC_Utility_Local for handling
#              specified edit areas (which can include marine) rather than
#              edit areas based only on CWA name.  Thresholds changed
#              extensively to add thresholds based on grid values.  Code
#              to eliminate border pairs with large elevation differences
#              changed to more reasonable code, since NDFD fixed their code.
#              Changed to make RED if the average discrepancy would violate
#              the 'by length' weighted average threshold (as NDFD does).
#              Turns ORANGE if it violates the threshold on ANY segment.
# 2004-09-05 - Version 2.1. Changes to ISC_Utility_Local for
#              handling areas where no neighbor exists.
# 2004-08-15 - Version 2.0. Thresholds are now hard-coded and derived by
#              average elevation difference for points considered (like NDFD)
#              but still WRONG (in my opinion).
# 2004-06-20 - Version 1.1. Various changes to vector checks to be somewhat
#              closer to NDFD checks - though they are in a state of flux.
# 2004-06-08 - Added support for multi-parms and vector parms
# 2004-05-19 - Tim Barker - SOO - Boise, ID
#              Changed to use new ISC_Utility_Local routines that make
#              discrepancy calculations identical to NDFD - and also to
#              color the gridblock red if ANY of the NDFD faces would be
#              "frowns".
#
#              To use this modified tool, you need to configure the
#              modified ISC_Utility_Local with a list of neighboring
#              sites (actually a list of edit areas for those sites),
#              and to set the algorithm to Neighboring Points
