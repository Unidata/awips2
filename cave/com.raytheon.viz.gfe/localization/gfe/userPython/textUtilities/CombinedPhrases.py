    ### Sky, PoP, Wx
       
##       The skyPopWx_phrase will produce a combined Sky, Pop, Wx phrase IF appropriate.
       
##       For example:
##        "Partly cloudy with a 20 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms."
##        "Sunny then partly cloudy with a 20 percent chance of
##          showers and thunderstorms in the afternoon."
## 
##        NOTE: IF you are using this phrase, you must also include the
##        sky_phrase, weather_phrase and popMax_phrase in your phraseList to be
##        used if the combined phrase cannot be generated.
## 
##        Based on algorithms by Chris Gibson and Brian Walawender
##         
##        This phrase operates much like the weather_phrase according to these rules :
       
##         --Sub-phrases are split out initially based on the Wx parameter. In other words,
##          "Wx" is the primary element.
##           Sub-phrases are consolidated and combined based on "Wx".
##         --Only precip-related weather types will be included in the phrase.
##           Non-precip-related weather types will be reported in a separate weather
##           phrase.
##         --After combining, if there are more than 2 sub-phrases, this phrase
##           is removed and independent Sky, PoP, and Wx phrases are generated.
##           Otherwise, independent sky_phrase, weather_phrase, popMax_phrases
##           are removed IF the information is to be included in the skyPopWx_phrase:
##            --If there are ANY areal coverage terms in the weather phrase, the PoP will
##              be reported in a separate phrase.  However, the Sky and Wx can still be reported
##              in the combined phrase.       
##            --Only one PoP value can be reported in a combined phrase, so if there are
##              multiple sub-phrases with precip, an independent PoP phrase will be generated.
##              E.g.: Partly cloudy with a chance of rain in the morning, then a 
##              chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon. Probability of precipitation 50 percent.
       
##         --If the value for Sky is the same throughout the period it will not be repeated.
##           Instead of: Partly cloudy with a chance of rain showers in the morning
##           then partly cloudy with a slight chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon.
##           Produce: Partly cloudy. A chance of rain showers in the morning then a 
##           slight chance of thunderstorms in the afternoon.
##

##   IMPLEMENTATION: This phrase takes into consideration Sky PoP and Wx,
##   checking for required criteria ("checkSkyPopWx"), combining on a sub-phrase by
##   sub-phrase basis, special handling of non-precip
##   ("separateNonPrecip") and the word method ("skyPopWx_words").
