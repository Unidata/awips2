# Gweight -- used for modifying the topo grid.
#
# Author:   romberg
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This special GFE configuration file is for modifying the topo
# grid that is stored on the ifpServer.  Starting the GFE
# with this configuration file should bring up a special GFE with
# just the Topo parameter.

# Include this line to override gfeConfig (BASE configuration):
from gfeConfig import *

# Hide this configuration file from users
HideConfigFile = 0

# Auto-load the group containing the geo weight weather elements
DefaultGroup = "EditTopo"

# The mutable model is set to "CG_Slider", to bring up the geoweight parameters
mutableModel = "EditTopo_Topo"

# The viewable database types is "CG" for the gweight.
dbTypes = ["EditTopo"]

# Turn off the split boundary display -- this is very important for performance due to the
# fact that these grids have a 1 second resolution
SplitBoundaryDisplay = no
