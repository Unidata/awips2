# Author: lefebvre
# This procedure copies the latest version of the hi res QPF grids which is the tpHPCndfd parameter
# from WPC grid found in the D2D HPCERP GFE model db. These grids are transmitted by WPC 4 times a day.
# The 00Z and 12Z cycles of data go out to day 7. 06Z and 18Z only go out 72 hours. The procedure
# makes an inventory check and populates the QPF grids using the latest HPCERP tpHPCndfd or a combination 
# of the latest HPCERP db and the previous one if the latest one is not completely in the system yet. 
# When the QPF grids are populated from combination of the latest model cycle and the previous model cycle the 
# tool will pop a banner telling you so. Also. the tool copies the guidance into 6 hours QPF grids 
# regardless whether the time constraint of your QPF grids is 1, 3, or 6 hours.
#
# If a time range is preselected in the Grid Manager, the tool only runs for that time range. Otherwise if no 
# time range is preselected the tool runs from the current 6 hours period out to 7 days using the latest
# guidance available as far out as it is available at the time the tool is ran.
#
# The tpHPCndfd parameter in the HPCERP D2D model db in GFE is the high resolution 2.5 km WPC QPF guidance.
# As of AWIPS build 16.1.2 and 16.2.1 this parameter is equivalent to accessing the following guidance from
# the D2D Volume Browser:
# 
# 1. From Sources -> SfcGrid -> HPC
# 2. From Fields -> Precip -> 6hr Precip Accum 
# 3. From Planes -> Misc -> Sfc
