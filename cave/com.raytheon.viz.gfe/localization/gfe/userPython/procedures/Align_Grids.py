# Align_Grids
#
# Author: Paul Jendrowski
# Version: 1.0 - 11/08/2004
#
# Description:
# This procedure will align the time ranges of selected
# weather elements with the time range of another element.
# For instance, this will redo the PoP grid to match
# the timeranges of individual Wx grids. Note that WindGust
# is always forced to match the Wind grid.
#
# If a grid does not exist, then it will be created from scratch.
# If the grid to align does exist, the max value of all original
# grids that are within the time range of the source grid is
# used for PoP, Sky, WindGust. Rate based parameters
# (QPF, SnowAmt, etc.) are fragmented then summed.
#
# You can add whatever elements you wish to VariableList. However,
# you must add an appropriate entry in the __init__ method
# to defing if the variable needs to be fragmented (i.e., rate
# based parameters like QPF must be fragmented to sum correctly),
# split (generally all non-rate based should be split before
# being recombined into the aligned grids). _methdodDict
# defines how to recompute the value for the aligned grid from
# the original grid.  This value is any value that can be used
# as the mode argument to SmartScript.getGrids method. In addition,
# you can also use "Last" to get the last grid or "MaxTime" which
# will select the grid that has the highest percentage time in the
# period (if a tie for highest percentage, the first is used).
# method is generally for Wx/discrete grids that cannot be
# averaged or summed.  Finally, the execute method needs to be
# edited to define time ranges to use for each new element.
#
# Installation:
#   Install this file as a Procedure. This procedure also requires
#   getGridsTool and MakeTmpGrid SmartTools to be installed.
