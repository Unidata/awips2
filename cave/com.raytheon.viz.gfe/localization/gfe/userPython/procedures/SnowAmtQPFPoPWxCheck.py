# SnowAmtQPFPoPWxCheck
#
# Author: Jay Smith, WFO Fairbanks, jay.smith@noaa.gov, 907-458-3721
# Version: 1.0.0, 09/14/2006 - Initial version
#          1.0.1, 10/12/2006 - Added PoP/QPF check at request of DSPAC
#          1.0.2, 10/18/2006 - Changed PoP/QPF check to treat the PoP as
#                 floating. Instead of checking each individual PoP grid
#                 against its corresponding QPF grid, the max of all the
#                 PoP grids overlapping a QPF grid will be checked.
#          1.1.0, 01/25/2007 - Added options to choose which checks to run.
#                 Reorganized code so that each check is its own method.
#                 Added a check for QPF and Wx. Added highlighting for the
#                 created temporary grids.
#          1.1.1, 02/01/2007 - Changed the SnowAmt/Wx check to return
#                 consistent results for SnowAmt > 0 and Wx grid containing
#                 S, SW, or IP regardless of whether the frozen precip is
#                 mixed with freezing and/or liquid precip.
#          1.2.0, 02/13/2007 - Added a configuration option to provide a CWA
#                 edit area to run the procedure over. A bad edit area or no
#                 edit area will result in running over the whole domain.
#                 Modified the SnowAmt/Wx and QPF/Wx checks to handle two
#                 cases. Case 1: The SnowAmt/QPF grid is 6-hr long and starts
#                 at 00, 06, 12, or 18 UTC. Then only one of the corresponding
#                 Wx grids has to meet the consistency rule. Case 2: The
#                 SnowAmt/QPF grid does not meet the case 1 definition. Then
#                 all of the corresponding Wx grids must meet the consistency
#                 rule.
# The procedure performs the following checks:
# 1. If SnowAmt present and >= 0.5 inches, then corresponding QPF grids
#    must add up to 0.01 inches.
# 2. If SnowAmt >= 0.1 inches, then there are two cases:
#    a. If the SnowAmt grid is exactly 6 hours long and starts at 00, 06, 12,
#       or 18 UTC, then at least one of the corresponding Wx grids must have
#       S, SW, or IP.
#    b. If the SnowAmt grid does not adhere to the time constraints listed in
#       in the previous paragraph, then all of the corresponding Wx grids
#       must have S, SW, or IP. This more stringent test is required because
#       with grids offset from the NDFD time constraints, it's possible for
#       the GFE to evaluate the grids as consistent using an "any"
#       criteria but have the NDFD flag those same grids as inconsistent.
# 3. If QPF > 0, then at least one of the corresponding PoP grids must be > 0
# 4. If QPF > 0, then there are two cases:
#    a. If the QPF grid is exactly 6 hours long and starts at 00, 06, 12, or 18
#       UTC, then at least one of the corresponding Wx grids must have R, RW,
#       S, SW, RS, IP, L, ZR, ZL.
#    b. If the QPF grid does not adhere to the time constraints listed in the
#       previous paragraph, then all corresponding Wx grids must contain a
#       precipitating weather type. This more stringent test is required
#       because with grids offset from the NDFD time constraints, it's
#       possible for the GFE to evaluate grids as consistent using an "any"
#       criteria but have the NDFD flag those same grids as inconsistent.
# For all of the checks above, if the initial threshold is not exceeded, then
# the two grids are consistent by definition. In other words:
# 1. If SnowAmt < 0.5, then SnowAmt and QPF are always consistent.
# 2. If SnowAmt < 0.1, then SnowAmt and Wx are always consistent.
# 3. If QPF = 0, then QPF and PoP are always consistent.
# 4. If QPF = 0, then QPF and Wx are always consistent.
# For the Wx checks above, only the Wx type is considered.
#
# ****** NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE ******
# At this time, the check for two 6-hour QPF grids vs. one 12-hr PoP grid
# is not implemented because neither of those grid definitions is implemented
# in the GFE baseline. I don't know how to do a check on grids that don't
# exist.
# ****** NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE ******
#
# If discrepancies are found, then the "bad" grids will be highlighted.
# Temporary grids showing where the discrepancies occur will be created and
# also highlighted.
#
# Dealing with QPF and SnowAmt is always a pain, because they are "cumulative"
# elements. This procedure will account for the possibility that the SnowAmt and
# QPF grids are not the same duration. It will also account for the possibilty
# that the SnowAmt and QPF grids are not aligned on either or both ends.
# The only sane way to handle either situation is to believe that the QPF
# accumulation happens uniformally across the grid's duration and to use
# the proportional amount of the QPF that corresponds the SnowAmt grid's
# duration. Some examples:
# 1. The QPF grid is 3 hours long and there are 3, 1-hour, SnowAmt grids.
# Each SnowAmt grid will be compared to 1/3 the value of the QPF grid.
# 2. The last two hours of a 3-hour QPF grid overlaps a 2-hour SnowAmt grid.
# The SnowAmt grid will be compared to 2/3 the value of the QPF grid.
# 3. Two 3-hour QPF grids align with one 6-hour SnowAmt grid. The first QPF
# grid will be compared to the SnowAmt grid. If the consistency check passes
# on that comparison, the program will continue. If the consistency check
# fails, then the sum of the two QPF grids will be compared to the SnowAmt
# grid.
# 4. The last four hours of a 6-hour QPF grid and the first two hours of a
# 3-hour QPF grid overlap a 6-hour SnowAmt grid. The SnowAmt grid will be
# compared to 2/3 of the first QPF grid. If the consistency check passes,
# the program will continue. If the consistency check fails, then 2/3 of the
# first QPF grid will be added to 2/3 of the second QPF grid and that QPF
# sum will be compared against the SnowAmt grid.
#
# Confused yet? Of course, all of these gyrations can be avoided if the
# QPF and SnowAmt grids are aligned and of the same duration.
#
# Unfortunately, the GFE does not provide a way to deal with proportional
# amounts of the accumulative grids, so I have done this.
#
# I've written this code such that it's optimized to minimize memory usage
# (at least I think I've done that). As a result, it's not particularly
# optimized for ifpServer database access. In fact, I retrieve the various
# grids from the ifpServer database many times during the procedure's run.
# This will have an impact on how fast the procedure runs (it'll run slower
# than if I had optimized for ifpServer database access). The choice to favor
# memory optimization comes from my belief that there are still "memory leak"
# problems in the GFE and that the consequences of those problems will be most
# manifest when this procedure is most likely to be run (near the end of the
# shift). Funky memory problems are a prime cause of funky application
# behavior like application crashes or spontaneous logouts. So, this procedure
# basically reads a grid into memory, keeps it as long as it's needed, and
# then discards it.
#
# Finally, this procedure is also intended to provide an example to other
# developers of how to write and document code. I have reservations as to how
# well I've succeeded at that task. The code is heavily documented, probably
# excessively so. Also, it's not as well as organized as it could be. As you
# look through the various methods, it should become quickly apparent that
# there is a lot of repeated code. I've consciously left the code this way in
# the hopes that it will be easier to understand by more novice programmers
# and because the code hasn't quite grown to the point where updating the
# repeating code is onerous or overly error-prone. It would be better to
# capture the repeating code in separate methods, but keeping track of the
# where you are in the code becomes harder the more you have to jump around
# from method to method. As with all things, there are trade-offs involved.

#### Config section
# Both the QPF and SnowAmt grids have values which are floating point
# numbers. This means comparisons must use a tolerance value. In other
# words, 0.5 may be represented in machine numbers as 0.49999999999 or
# 0.500000000001. By specifying a tolerance value, we account for the
# vagaries of machine representation of floating point numbers while
# keeping the precision of the comparisons to acceptable levels. Depending
# on the comparison being done, the tolerance value will be added to or
# subtracted from the comparison value to allow for machine error in the
# floating point number representation.
# By default in the GFE, QPF precision is to the nearest one-hundredth while
# SnowAmt precision is to the nearest tenth.
qpfTol = 0.00001  # 1/100,000 tolerance vs 1/100 precision
snowAmtTol = 0.0001  # 1/10,000 tolerance vs 1/10 precision
# Inconsistent grid highlight color. One size fits all. To turn off
# highlighting, set the variable to the empty string, ''.

# Temporary grid highlight color. One size fits all. To turn off highlighting,

tempGridColor = 'orange'
# Name of CWA edit area to use instead of running the procedure over the
# whole domain. Set to the empty string, '', if you want the procedure to
# always run over the whole domain. If the procedure has a problem with the
# edit area you provide, it will run over the whole domain. You should probably
# choose an edit area that is slightly larger than your entire CWA. It's
# possible that when mapping your GFE grids to NDFD grids that the NDFD thinks
# some GFE grid cells are in your CWA that the GFE does not think are in your
# CWA. Using an edit area slightly larger than the CWA, like the ISC_Send_Area
# which is the mask used when sending grids to the NDFD, should eliminate the
# possibibilty of the NDFD intermittently flagging CWA border "points" as
# inconsistent. Note: running the procedure over a subset of the entire GFE
# domain does not really provide any performance gains. Given the way the
# underlying array data structure works, calculations are almost always made
# at every single grid point first and then a mask is applied to limit the
# meaningful results to the edit area. For the purposes of this procedure, the
# values outside the edit area are set to the appropriate "consistent" result.
# The real benefit of this option is it limits the inconsistent results to the
# areas the forecaster really cares about, which should lessen the workload of
# using this procedure. Marine Offices: Make sure the edit area provided
# includes your marine zones.
