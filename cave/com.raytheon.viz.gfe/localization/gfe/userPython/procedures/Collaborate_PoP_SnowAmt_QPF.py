# Collaborate_PoP_SnowAmt_QPF - Version 3.0
#
# Description: Calls smart tools to generate PoP12hr, SnowAmt6hr, and QPF6hr
#              grids from the "floating" PoP, SnowAmt, and QPF grids. These
#              grids can be used for intersite coordination purposes, as well
#              as the generation of graphics for the internet. 
#              
# Author: John Rozbicki (IFPS FP), NWS Buffalo, NY
#
# Changes for Version 3.0 (August 2003):
#       * Changed to create collaboration grids using time constraints that
#         are based on GMT instead of LT. 
#       * Modified the samplelocalConfig.py file to reflect the new time
#         constraints for the collaboration grids.
#       * Modified the procedure code to use GMT instead of LT when
#         determining the current time and the initial time ranges for the
#         collaboration grids.
#       * Added code to allow a site to specify a default edit area over
#         which to run the tool.
#
# Changes/Enhancements for Version 2.1 (July 2003):
#       * Changed to use version 2.0 of Paul Jendrowski's MakeTmpGrid smart
#         tool (allows procedure to run correctly in IFPS 14).
#       * Corrected samplelocalConfig.py file to indicate correct ISC time
#         constraints.
#       *** No Changes were made to the procedure code in this file with
#           Version 2.1. ***
#
# Enhancements for Version 2.0 (March 2003):
#       (courtesy Paul Jendrowski, NWS Blacksburg, VA 2/25/03)
#       * Changed to use generic smart tools.
#       * Changed to to do better checking for existing grids and time ranges.
#       * Changed so the procedure now automatically deletes the temporary
#         grids needed to sum up SnowAmt and QPF into collaboration grids.
#
# Date Last Modified: 08/10/03
# Purpose: Modify to use GMT instead of LT when determining the current time
#          and the initial time ranges for the collaboration grids
