# NDFD_QPF_Checks (was SnowAmtQPFPoPWxCheck)

# Author: Jay Smith, WFO Fairbanks, jay.smith@noaa.gov, 907-458-3721
# SnowAmtQPFPoPWxCheck Incarnation
# Version: 1.0.0, 09/14/2006 - Initial version
#          1.0.1, 10/12/2006 - Added PoP/QPF check at request of DSPAC
#          1.0.2, 10/18/2006 - Changed PoP/QPF check to treat the PoP as
#                 floating. Instead of checking each individual PoP grid
#                 against its corresponding QPF grid, the max of all the
#                 PoP grids overlapping a QPF grid will be checked.
#          1.1.0, 01/25/2007 - Added options to choose which checks to run.
#                 Reorganized code so that each check is its own method.
#                 Added a check for QPF and Wx. Added highlighting for the
#                 created temporary grids.
#          1.1.1, 02/01/2007 - Changed the SnowAmt/Wx check to return
#                 consistent results for SnowAmt > 0 and Wx grid containing
#                 S, SW, or IP regardless of whether the frozen precip is
#                 mixed with freezing and/or liquid precip.
#          1.2.0, 02/13/2007 - Added a configuration option to provide a CWA
#                 edit area to run the procedure over. A bad edit area or no
#                 edit area will result in running over the whole domain.
#                 Modified the SnowAmt/Wx and QPF/Wx checks to handle two
#                 cases. Case 1: The SnowAmt/QPF grid is 6-hr long and starts
#                 at 00, 06, 12, or 18 UTC. Then only one of the corresponding
#                 Wx grids has to meet the consistency rule. Case 2: The
#                 SnowAmt/QPF grid does not meet the case 1 definition. Then
#                 all of the corresponding Wx grids must meet the consistency
#                 rule.
# NDFD_QPF_Checks Incarnation
# Version: 1.0.0, 04/04/2007 - The program now requires the presence of the
#                 following 3 grids: QPF6hr, SnowAmt6hr, and PoP12hr. The 2
#                 6-hr grids are expected to start at 00, 06, 12, or 18 UTC
#                 and be exactly 6 hours long. The PoP12hr grids are expected
#                 to start at 00 or 12 UTC and be exactly 12 hours long.
#                 The procedure still needs the PoP and Wx grids. With these
#                 grid changes, the procedure can now finally perform the last
#                 of the required NDFD checks. This also means there is no
#                 longer the need for two check cases in the two "Wx" checks.
#                 Now, Wx is consistent if any of its grids have the appropriate
#                 type. The procedure can now be run in a "quiet" mode if
#                 called from another procedure. Any messages generated in
#                 "quiet" mode will be of "R" severity so no pop-up messages
#                 are generated but the information is still available from the
#                 GFE status bar area. All error messages are templated in a
#                 dictionary in a separate method. This allows me to put all
#                 the triple-quoted strings, which ignore indentation, in one
#                 location. The code for checking for locked grids was also
#                 templated in its own method, which chopped about 15 lines of
#                 code off the front of each check method. There were a couple
#                 of places where I was applying the "tolerance" values
#                 incorrectly, which have been fixed. I dropped the
#                 "Inconsistent" label from all temporary grid names. I was
#                 making those grid names so long, they didn't actually fit
#                 in the spatial editor window when the grid manager was on
#                 the left. Temporary grid names now are just a concatenation
#                 of the two grids used in the check.
# Version: 1.1.0, The logic for the handling of inconsistencies in the
#                 SnowAmt6hr/Wx, QPF6hr/Wx, and PoP12hr/QPF6hr checks could
#                 result in false positive inconsistencies. This is because
#                 I was checking for inconsistencies on each of these grids
#                 individually when I needed to be checking the cumulative
#                 inconsistencies of these grids. With the new logic, if any
#                 of these checks has inconsistencies, the resulting temporary
#                 grid will have the same time range as the "controlling" grid,
#                 which is the first grid listed in each check name. Also, I
#                 have enforced the precision of the SnowAmt6hr and QPF6hr
#                 grids in the methods where they are used. SmartScript has a
#                 method called "around" that does this. I ran into an issue
#                 when this procedure was called from NDFD_QPF_Suite. I am
#                 unable to figure out how to uncache the QPF6hr, SnowAmt6hr,
#                 and PoP12hr grids after they are generated by the
#                 Collaborate_PoP_SnowAmt_QPF procedure. For the QPF6hr and
#                 SnowAmt6hr grids, this means getGrids is getting them from
#                 the cache, which means these float parameters have machine
#                 precision. This is utterly unacceptable. I have to have
#                 ifpServer precision. Now, I think I've ensured this.
#          1.1.1, 05/02/2007 - There have been instances of unexpected procedure
#                 performance if the NDFD QPF parameters are not visible in the
#                 grid manager when the procedure is run. The procedure will
#                 now require the existence of a weather element group which
#                 contains just the NDFP QPF parameters.
#          1.2.0, 05/03/2007 - Upon further review, the unexpected procedure
#                 performance arises when some of the NDFD QPF parameters are
#                 not present in the grid manager. However, I do not need to
#                 load a weather element group to make the parameters present.
#                 I can use the loadParm command on each element instead. Given
#                 this, the "weGroup" configuration has been removed. Also,
#                 some people believe the lock checking is overly stringent.
#                 To some extent, I agree. For the purposes of this procedure,
#                 other GFE users can have any of the NDFD QPF parmeteres
#                 locked. The user running the procedure, however, cannot have
#                 any of the parameters locked; i.e., that person must save
#                 those elements before running the procedure.
# The procedure performs the following checks:
# 1. If SnowAmt6hr present and >= 0.5 inches, then corresponding QPF6hr grids
#    must be >= 0.01 inches.
# 2. If SnowAmt6hr >= 0.1 inches then at least one of the corresponding Wx
#    grids must have S, SW, or IP.
# 3. If QPF6hr > 0.0, then at least one of the corresponding PoP grids must
#    be > 0
# 4. If QPF6hr > 0.0 then at least one of the corresponding Wx grids must have
#    R, RW, S, SW, RS, IP, L, ZR, ZL.
# 5. If PoP12hr >= 50%, then at least one of the corresponding QPF6hr grids
#    must be >= 0.0.
# For all of the checks above, if the initial threshold is not exceeded, then
# the two grids are consistent by definition. In other words:
# 1. If SnowAmt6hr < 0.5, then SnowAmt6hr and QPF6hr are always consistent.
# 2. If SnowAmt6hr < 0.1, then SnowAmt6hr and Wx are always consistent.
# 3. If QPF6hr = 0.0, then QPF6hr and PoP are always consistent.
# 4. If QPF6hr = 0.0, then QPF6hr and Wx are always consistent.
# 5. If PoP12hr < 50%, then PoP12hr and QPF6hr are always consistent.
# For the Wx checks above, only the Wx type is considered.
#
# ****** NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE ******
# The program checks the PoP12hr, QPF6hr, and SnowAmt6hr grids to make sure
# their time constraints are met. For any grid where the time constraint is
# violated, those grids are not checked. To reiterate the time constraints:
# PoP12hr: starts at either 00 or 12 UTC and is exactly 12 hours duration
# QPF6hr: starts at 00, 06, 12, or 18 UTC and is exactly 6 hours duration
# SnowAmt6hr: starts at 00, 06, 12 or 18 UTC and is exactly 6 hours duration
# ****** NOTE NOTE NOTE NOTE ******
#
# If discrepancies are found, then the "bad" grids will be highlighted.
# Temporary grids showing where the discrepancies occur will be created and
# also highlighted.
#
# I've written this code such that it's optimized to minimize memory usage
# (at least I think I've done that). As a result, it's not particularly
# optimized for ifpServer database access. In fact, I retrieve the various
# grids from the ifpServer database many times during the procedure's run.
# This will have an impact on how fast the procedure runs (it'll run slower
# than if I had optimized for ifpServer database access). The choice to favor
# memory optimization comes from my belief that there are still "memory leak"
# problems in the GFE and that the consequences of those problems will be most
# manifest when this procedure is most likely to be run (near the end of the
# shift). Funky memory problems are a prime cause of funky application
# behavior like application crashes or spontaneous logouts. So, this procedure
# basically reads a grid into memory, keeps it as long as it's needed, and
# then discards it.
#
# Finally, this procedure is also intended to provide an example to other
# developers of how to write and document code. I have reservations as to how
# well I've succeeded at that task. The code is heavily documented, probably
# excessively so. Also, it's not as well as organized as it could be. As you
# look through the various methods, it should become quickly apparent that
# there is a lot of repeated code. I've consciously left some the code this
# way in the hopes that it will be easier to understand by more novice
# programmers and because the code hasn't quite grown to the point where
# updating the repeating code is onerous or overly error-prone. It would be
# better to capture the repeating code in separate methods, but keeping track
# of the where you are in the code becomes harder the more you have to jump
# around from method to method. Anyone who has ever worked with the text
# formatters can sympathize with that. As with all things, there are trade-
# offs involved. UPDATE: 4/3/2007 - Starting with the first NDFD_QPF_Checks
# version, I consolidated quite a bit of the repeating code into separate
# methods. So, there's some improvement on that front.

# Both the QPF and SnowAmt grids have values which are floating point
# numbers. This means comparisons must use a tolerance value. In other
# words, 0.5 may be represented in machine numbers as 0.49999999999 or
# 0.500000000001. By specifying a tolerance value, we account for the
# vagaries of machine representation of floating point numbers while
# keeping the precision of the comparisons to acceptable levels. Depending
# on the comparison being done, the tolerance value will be added to or
# subtracted from the comparison value to allow for machine error in the
# floating point number representation.
# By default in the GFE, QPF precision is to the nearest one-hundredth while
# SnowAmt precision is to the nearest tenth.
qpfTol = 0.00001  # 1/100,000 tolerance vs 1/100 precision

# Name of CWA edit area to use instead of running the procedure over the
# whole domain. Set to the empty string, '', if you want the procedure to
# always run over the whole domain. If the procedure has a problem with the
# edit area you provide, it will run over the whole domain. You should probably
# choose an edit area that is slightly larger than your entire CWA. It's
# possible that when mapping your GFE grids to NDFD grids that the NDFD thinks
# some GFE grid cells are in your CWA that the GFE does not think are in your
# CWA. Using an edit area slightly larger than the CWA, like the ISC_Send_Area
# which is the mask used when sending grids to the NDFD, should eliminate the
# possibibilty of the NDFD intermittently flagging CWA border "points" as
# inconsistent. Note: running the procedure over a subset of the entire GFE
# domain does not really provide any performance gains. Given the way the
# underlying array data structure works, calculations are almost always made
# at every single grid point first and then a mask is applied to limit the
# meaningful results to the edit area. For the purposes of this procedure, the
# values outside the edit area are set to the appropriate "consistent" result.
# The real benefit of this option is it limits the inconsistent results to the
# areas the forecaster really cares about, which should lessen the workload of
# using this procedure. Marine Offices: Make sure the edit area provided
# includes your marine zones.
