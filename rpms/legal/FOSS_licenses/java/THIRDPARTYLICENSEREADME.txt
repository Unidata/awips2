      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

This formulation of W3C's notice and license became active on December 31 2002. This version removes the
copyright ownership notice such that this license can be used with materials other than those owned by the
W3C, reflects that ERCIM is now a host of the W3C, includes references to this specific dated version of the
license, and removes the ambiguous grant of "use". Otherwise, this version is the same as the previous
version and is written so as to preserve the Free Software Foundation's assessment of GPL compatibility and
OSI's certification under the Open Source Definition. Please see our Copyright FAQ for common questions

                         SAX is free!

                         In fact, it's not possible to own a license to SAX, since it's been placed in the public
                         domain. 

                         No Warranty

                         Because SAX is released to the public domain, there is no warranty for the design or for
                         the software implementation, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when
                         otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties provide SAX "as is"
                         without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
                         implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as
                         to the quality and performance of SAX is with you. Should SAX prove defective, you
                         assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

                         In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright
                         holder, or any other party who may modify and/or redistribute SAX, be liable to you for
                         damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of
                         the use or inability to use SAX (including but not limited to loss of data or data being
                         rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the SAX to
                         operate with any other programs), even if such holder or other party has been advised of
                         the possibility of such damages.

 *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License. *
 *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      as of the date such litigation is filed.

      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

(a) If you choose to redistribute Sample Code, or Redistributable Code 
(collectively, the "Redistributables") as described in Section 2, you agree: (i) except as otherwise 
noted in Section 2.1 (Sample Code), to distribute the Redistributables only in object code form 
and in conjunction with and as a part of a software application product developed by you that 
adds significant and primary functionality to the Redistributables ("Licensee Software"); 
(ii) that the Redistributables only operate in conjunction with Microsoft Windows platforms; 
(iii) that if the Licensee Software is distributed beyond Licensee's premises or externally from

Software as delivered to you; (vii) to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Microsoft from and 
against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from the use or 
distribution of the Licensee Software; (viii) to otherwise comply with the terms of this EULA; 
and (ix) agree that Microsoft reserves all rights not expressly granted. 
You also agree not to permit further distribution of the Redistributables by your 
end users except you may permit further redistribution of the Redistributables by your 
distributors to your end-user customers if your distributors only distribute the Redistributables 
in conjunction with, and as part of, the Licensee Software, you comply with all other terms of 
this EULA, and your distributors comply with all restrictions of this EULA that are applicable 
to you. 

(b) If you use the Redistributables, then in addition to your compliance with 
the applicable distribution requirements described for the Redistributables, the following also

derivative works of the Redistributables in any manner that would cause the Redistributables in 
whole or in part to become subject to any of the terms of an Excluded License; or (ii) 
distributing the Redistributables (or derivative works thereof) in any manner that would cause 
the Redistributables to become subject to any of the terms of an Excluded License. An 
"Excluded License" is any license that requires as a condition of use, modification and/or 
distribution of software subject to the Excluded License, that such software or other software

requires your customers to license Microsoft Access in order to operate, you shall not 
reproduce or use MSDE for commercial distribution in conjunction with a general 
purpose word processing, spreadsheet or database management software product, or an 
integrated work or product suite whose components include a general purpose word 
processing, spreadsheet, or database management software product except for the 
exclusive use of importing data to the various formats supported by Microsoft Access. 
A product that includes limited word processing, spreadsheet or database components 
along with other components which provide significant and primary value, such as an 
accounting product with limited spreadsheet capability, is not considered to be a 
"general purpose" product. 
(b) Microsoft Data Access Components. If you redistribute the Microsoft 
Data Access Component file identified as MDAC_TYP.EXE, you also agree to 
redistribute such file in object code only in conjunction with and as a part of a Licensee

component parts, the media and printed materials, any upgrades (including any Qualifying 
Software as defined in Section 11.3), this EULA, and, if applicable, the Certificate of 
Authenticity). The transfer may not be an indirect transfer, such as a consignment. Prior to the

17. LIMITED WARRANTY FOR SOFTWARE ACQUIRED IN THE US AND CANADA. 
Except for the "Redistributables," which are provided AS IS without warranty of any kind, 
Microsoft warrants that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the 
accompanying materials for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt. 

If an implied warranty or condition is created by your state/jurisdiction and federal or 
state/provincial law prohibits disclaimer of it, you also have an implied warranty or condition, 
BUT ONLY AS TO DEFECTS DISCOVERED DURING THE PERIOD OF THIS LIMITED 
WARRANTY (NINETY DAYS). AS TO ANY DEFECTS DISCOVERED AFTER THE 
NINETY-DAY PERIOD, THERE IS NO WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF ANY KIND. 

Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty or


condition lasts, so the above limitation may not apply to you.
Any supplements or updates to the Software, including without limitation, any (if any) service
packs or hot fixes provided to you after the expiration of the ninety day Limited Warranty
period are not covered by any warranty or condition, express, implied or statutory.


LIMITATION ON REMEDIES; NO CONSEQUENTIAL OR OTHER DAMAGES. Your
exclusive remedy for any breach of this Limited Warranty is as set forth below. Except for any
refund elected by Microsoft, YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, if the Software does
not meet Microsoft's Limited Warranty, and, to the maximum extent allowed by applicable
law, even if any remedy fails of its essential purpose. The terms of Section 19 ("Exclusion of
Incidental, Consequential and Certain Other Damages") are also incorporated into this Limited
Warranty. Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. This
Limited Warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have other rights which vary from
state/jurisdiction to state/jurisdiction. YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. Microsoft's and its
suppliers' entire liability and your exclusive remedy for any breach of this Limited Warranty or
for any other breach of this EULA or for any other liability relating to the Software shall be, at
Microsoft's option from time to time exercised subject to applicable law, (a) return of the
amount paid (if any) for the Software, or (b) repair or replacement of the Software, that does not
meet this Limited Warranty and that is returned to Microsoft with a copy of your receipt. You
will receive the remedy elected by Microsoft without charge, except that you are responsible for
any expenses you may incur (e.g. cost of shipping the Software to Microsoft). This Limited
Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication,

abnormal use or a virus. Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the
original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer, and Microsoft will use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide your remedy within a commercially reasonable time
of your compliance with Microsoft's warranty remedy procedures. Outside the United States or
Canada, neither these remedies nor any product support services offered by Microsoft are
available without proof of purchase from an authorized international source. To exercise your
remedy, contact: Microsoft, Attn. Microsoft Sales Information Center/One Microsoft
Way/Redmond, WA 98052-6399, or the Microsoft subsidiary serving your country.

The following MICROSOFT GUARANTEE applies to you if you acquired this Software in

Statutory rights not affected -The following guarantee is not restricted to any territory and does 
not affect any statutory rights that you may have from your reseller or from Microsoft if you

services in Australia, New Zealand or Malaysia, please see the "Consumer rights" section 
below.

The guarantee -The Software is designed and offered as a general-purpose software, not for any 
user's particular purpose. You accept that no Software is error free and you are strongly 
advised to back-up your files regularly. Provided that you have a valid license, Microsoft 
guarantees that a) for a period of 90 days from the date of receipt of your license to use the 
Software or the shortest period permitted by applicable law it will perform substantially in 
accordance with the written materials that accompany the Software; and b) any support services 
provided by Microsoft shall be substantially as described in applicable written materials 
provided to you by Microsoft and Microsoft support engineers will use reasonable efforts, care 
and skill to solve any problem issues. In the event that the Software fails to comply with this 
guarantee, Microsoft will either (a) repair or replace the Software or (b) return the price you 
paid. This guarantee is void if failure of the Software results from accident, abuse or 
misapplication. Any replacement Software will be guaranteed for the remainder of the original 
guarantee period or 30 days, whichever period is longer. You agree that the above guarantee is 
your sole guarantee in relation to the Software and any support services. 

Exclusion of All Other Terms -To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and subject to 
the guarantee above, Microsoft disclaims all warranties, conditions and other terms, either 
express or implied (whether by statute, common law, collaterally or otherwise) including but 
not limited to implied warranties of satisfactory quality and fitness for particular purpose with 
respect to the Software and the written materials that accompany the Software. Any implied 
warranties that cannot be excluded are limited to 90 days or to the shortest period permitted by 
applicable law, whichever is greater. 

Limitation of Liability -To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except as 
provided in the Microsoft Guarantee, Microsoft and its suppliers shall not be liable for any 
damages whatsoever (including without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, 
business interruption, loss of business information or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the 
use or inability to use the Software, even if Microsoft has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages. In any case Microsoft's entire liability under any provision of this Agreement shall be 
limited to the amount actually paid by you for the Software. These limitations do not apply to 
any liabilities that cannot be excluded or limited by applicable laws. 

Consumer rights -Consumers in Australia, New Zealand or Malaysia may have the benefit of 
certain rights and remedies by reason of the Trade Practices Act and similar state and territory 
laws in Australia, the Consumer Guarantees Act in New Zealand and the Consumer Protection 
Act in Malaysia in respect of which liability cannot lawfully be modified or excluded. If you 
acquired the Software in New Zealand for the purposes of a business, you confirm that the 
Consumer Guarantees Act does not apply. If you acquired the Software in Australia and if 
Microsoft breaches a condition or warranty implied under any law which cannot lawfully be 
modified or excluded by this agreement then, to the extent permitted by law, Microsoft's 
liability is limited, at Microsoft's option, to: (i) in the case of the Software: a) repairing or 
replacing the Software; or b) the cost of such repair or replacement; and (ii) in the case of 
support services: a) re-supply of the services; or b) the cost of having the services supplied

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."


      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
