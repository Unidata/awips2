REMARKS:
181500Z POSITION NEAR 24.4S 161.4W.
TROPICAL CYCLONE (TC) 21P (KEN), LOCATED APPROXIMATELY 190 NM SOUTH-
SOUTHWEST OF RAROTONGA, HAS TRACKED SOUTHEASTWARD OVER THE PAST
06 HOURS. RECENT ANIMATED INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS LITTLE
CHANGE IN THE CONVECTIVE SIGNATURE OVER THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION
CENTER (LLCC). AN 180420Z QUIKSCAT PASS REFLECT AN ELONGATION IN THE
LLCC WITH 30 KT UNFLAGGED WINDS. THE LLCC IS CURRENTLY LOCATED IN
FAVORABLE SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES, BUT SST VALUES WILL CONTINUE TO
DECREASE OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS, BECOMING UNFAVORABLE BEYOND TAU 24.
AN APPROACHING MID-LATITUDE TROUGH HAS BEGUN TO ACCELERATE TC 21P
TO THE SOUTHEAST AND EXTRA-TROPICAL (ET) TRANSISTION HAS STARTED.
TC 21P WILL REMAIN AN INTENSE ET STORM WITH WINDS REMAINING NEAR
35 KNOTS AFTER TRANSITION. THE SYSTEM WILL COMPLETE ET BY TAU 24.
MAXIMUM SIGNIFICANT WAVE HEIGHT AT 181200Z IS 10 FEET. NEXT
WARNINGS AT 190300Z.//
