     Release metar_ver6.9 
     November 20, 2004
     ********************
     Change 128: 

                  New Command Line Option: -log
		  When this option is included in the command line, a log
		  will be turned on.  This will tell the decoder to first
		  copy the current file being processed to the ../err
		  directory, before any decoding takes place. The name
		  of the file will be, 'latest_metar_file'.  It will be overwritten
		  each time a new file is processed.  The default for this
		  option is set to off, and no file will be produced.

     Change 129:
		  
		  New Command Line Option: -pct #
		  When this option is included in the command line, the decoder
		  will check the metar.cfg file for a list of id's that may
		  have a reset time associated with resetting the hourly 
		  precipitation gage.  The reset times are not necessarilly
		  on the hour.  They need to be accounted for so that the 
		  proper duration for preciptation can be computed.  
		  If the id is found in the list, it 
		  will use the reset time (associated with the id) to compute
		  the duration of precipitation.  The '#' is an integer that
		  represents a Tolerance level, described below.
		  

                  The algorithm is as follows:
		  
	          if ( observation_minute  > reset_minute) && observation_minute  <= 60.0 )
	          {
	             duration_time = observation_minute   - reset_minute);	    
	          }
	          else
	          {
	             duration_time = observation_minute  + 60.0  - reset_minute);
	          }
	       
	          if ( (60.0 - duration_time ) <= TOLERANCE )
	             duration_time = 60.;

                  Note: The tolerance value is only used for observation times that
		  are very near the reset time, but the reset has not yet occured.
		  In this case, the duration_time is set to the full hour (60 minutes).
		  If the observation occurs just after the reset time, the tolerance
		  value is not used.
		  The shef encoding for this precipitation uses the variable duration
		  code, i.e. 'PPV'.
		  
		  IMPORTANT: This option requires that the metar.cfg file be edited.
		  A sample of a metar.cfg file is below.  The section that needs to 
		  be added is, e.g., 
		  		  
                 .begin_pc_reset
                 KABC 20 
                 PAYA 20 
                 .end_pc_reset
		 
		 The first group is the id, the second group is the reset time (minutes).
		 
		 Below is a sample metar.cfg file with the additional reset group included.
		  
		  /local/apps/decoders/metar/alpha/test/in
                  /local/apps/decoders/metar/alpha/test/out

                 PAYA 20 
                 .end_pc_reset

		   
     Change 130:
                  The precipitation type, PTIR was corrected so that now it will not
		  be encoded in shef if there is no current type.  Previoulsy, a value
		  of -1 was encoded.
		  
		  
     Change 131:

                  The shef code for, new 24 snowfall depth was added. This is encoded
		  as, SFDRZZZ. This is the 24/931sss group located in SCD reports.
		  The code for new 6 hour snowfall depth is, SFQRZZZ.
		  The water equivalent codes are, SWIRZZZ.
		  
     Change 132:

                  An internal change was made on how the decoder determined whether
		  a line was the begnning of a METAR ob, or a continuation line.
		  Previous versions looked (among other things) for the wind group, 
		  and if found assummed that was the first line of an ob.  
		  It was determined that winds groups showed up in the RMKs section, 
		  and made this assumption invalid.		  

     Change 134:
     		  If more than a trace of precip has fallen, but the amount cannot
		  be determined, the 7 group is decoded as 7////.  Previously, when
		  this occurred, a 0 was encoded.  The current version sends no value.

     January 16, 2004
     ********************
     Change 127: 

                  The following fixes fixes Change 126.  When that changed
		  was made, it complicated other problems, e.g., the 
		  maintenance indicator could not be read and a segmentation
		  fault occurred.  This change simply first bumped the token
		  and checked for a null.  The subsequent bumping was removed
		  since it was already bumped for the null check.
		 

     ******************** 
     Release metar_ver6.7 
     December 17, 2003
     ********************
     Change 126: 

                  Found another place where if you bumped the token, (++token)
		  it went to a NULL.   Put a check for a NULL.  This was in
		  routine isVsby2ndSite. 

     ******************** 
     Release metar_ver6.6 
     April 03, 2002
     ********************
     Change 125: 
	          Redo section of code using the -p12z, -p24 and -pall24
		 switches. 
		     
                 The following logic now applies:
		 -p12z only applies to seven groups ( e.g. 70020 )
		 that exist.  If the -p12z switch exists (true) and
		 a seven group exists, the 24 data will ONLY be 
		 encoded for obs in the time window ( 1140 - 1230Z ).
		 If the -p12z switch does not exist (false ) and
		 a seven group exists, the 24 hour data will be 
		 encoded for any observation time.  Note: the -p12z
		 has no affect on determining if zero observations
		 will be generated or not.
		    
		 The generation of 24 hour amounts of zero is determined
		 by the existence of the -pall24 and/or -p24 switches.
		 NOTE: a zero amount will ONLY be generated for an
		 observation that exists in the 1140-1230Z window.
		 There is no way to distinguish in a METAR ob which
		 stations report or do not report 24 hour precipitation
		 data.
		    
		 If the -pall24 switch is true, a zero amount for the
		 24 hours ending at 12z will be generated for every
		 site ( as long as the site does not explicitly have
		 a 7 group..in which case the data in the 7 group will
		 be transmitted.)
		    
		 If the -p24 switch is true, a zero amount for 24 hours
		 ending at 12Z will be generated for ONLY automated sites
		 ( that have a A01 or AO2 indicator) ( as long as the site 
	         does not explicitly have a 7 group..in which case the 
		 data in the 7 group will be transmitted.)

     June 02, 2002
     ********************
     
     Change 123: Loosen tolerance times for decoding 3 and 6 hour
		 precip groups in a regular metar ob.  
		 Function: shef_it_metar
		 
		 They are now:
		    
		   code as a 6 hour total

     Change 122:  	
     Add a blank before the "SPECI" string, making it " SPECI", in function metardrive.  
     Before this change, NOSPECI was incorrectly detected as SPECI.  Obs that were
     noted with NOSPECI in the remarks section were encoded ( incorrectly ) as
     SPECI obs.

     Change 119:  Remove rounding for wind in UQ
     
     Remove the +.5 for rounding wind speeds for
     the UQ since the speed is reported to ss.s
     and not ss ( or unity )..no need to round.

     Change 117:  Return statement
     
     Add a return(0) at the bottom of function metar_ob_time.

     exist ...  as a precaution.
		 
     Change 114: Fix PE and PD Codes
      
     Switch pe codes of PD and PE.  PD should be
     pressure change/tendency and PE pressure
     characteristic.  This is in the shef_it_metar
     function and the output is switched.
		 
     Change 115: 
     
     Change -asosts switch to -l .
		 
     Change 116:  New switch -q1

     j1 = output observation + decode list
     j2 = output observation only
     j3 = output decode list only

     ********************
     
     Change 111: New switch, -salias

     New switch, -salias.  When present, the decoder will
     check an alias id table in the cfg file and alias
     numerical 'sm' ids to three characters ids.



     ******************** 
     Release metar_ver5.6 
     February 4, 2000
     ********************

     Change 109: Handle SPECI's in Collectives
     
     Collectives can now contain all SPECI's.  However, each
     individual ob is not marked as a SPECI.  The token 'SPECI'
     is contained at the top of file, indicating that all obs
     in the file are SPECI.  The decoder now handles this and
     notes individual obs as SPECI's.
     
     Change 110:  New Switch '-g' 
     
     { The default is to decode and produce shef output for all ids. }

     NOTE: If you trigger your metars from INFORMIX (AIWPS) you will
     probably not want to use this option.  It is designed for offices
     that send collectives directly from the SBN (bypassing triggers)
     to the decoder queues.
     
     When this switch is included on the command line the decoder will
     read in a list of ids from the configuration file.  SHEF output will
     only be produced for these ids.  All other observations will be
     tossed out.  The decoder arrays are sized to read in up to
     2000 ids.  The decoder will key off the phrases:
     
     .begin_names
     
         and
     
     .end_names
     
     The ids must be within the phrases, with one id per line.
     If you use the four character ids then you must enter the
     four characters.  If you use the -a option and strip off the 
     'k' then you can either enter the four or three character id.
     
     A sample of how to include the ids in the metar.cfg file is shown below:

     January 10, 2000
     ********************

     Change 100: Use Temperatures in T Group

     The decoder will use and output the temperatures in the 
     'T' group if one exists.  These temperatures are reported
     to tenths of a degree.  Previously, the decoder used the
     the temperatures/dew points ( which were not in tenths of 
     a degree ) located in the main body of the observation.
     This change was requested by OH, Jeff Zimmerman.  If not
     'T' group exists the decoder will use the temperatures in
     the main body of the observations.

     Change 101:   Internal Code Change for Setting File Pointers

     All file pointers are now set to NULL after they are closed.
     The compiler on LINUX does not set file pointers to NULL
     after they are closed.  This caused a segmentation fault
     on Linux systems.     

     Change 102:  Add a New Switch -x #

     This switch is strictly used in testing, and will not be 
     used in operations.  The switch allows a user/developer to
     internally set/override the system date/time.  This switch
     will only work if the -t (test) switch is also on.		

                Allow for year, month, and day.  For example:
                -x 2000         override system year & set to 2000
                -x 200012       override year and month
                -x 20001231     override year, month and day
                -x 2000123100   override year,month, day, hour
                -x 200012311010 override year,month,day,hour,min          

     Change 103:  Set the -b Switch on Permanently

     The -b switch is set if collectives are decoded.  The logic
     is now set that single observations or collectives are decoded.
     It makes no difference to the decoder.


     Change 104:  Change in Observation Time Computation

     There is now a change in the way that the observation date/time
     is determined.  Some observations explicitly contain the 
     day and time. Others may only contain the time (but not the day).
     The algorithm used depends on whether the day is explicitly contained 
     in the observation or not.
		   
     *** No Day in Observation  **
     If the day is not included in the observation, the system year, 
     month and day are used along with the observation time.
		   
     *** Day Explicitly Provided in Observation */
     If the day is included in the observation, the system year and 
     month are used, but the day is checked/compared with the 
     system day.  

     If the day in the observation is > than the system 
     day, it is assumed that the month is the previous month 
     ( otherwise decrement the system month and the system year 
     if necessary).    

     If the day in the observation is equal to the system day, 
     and the observation time is greater than the system time, 
     use the current day, but print out a warning. If the observation
     time is less than the system time, use the current day 
     ( and no warning is printed ).

     If the day in the observation is < the system day, it is assumed
     to use the system month and year.      																	  


     Change 105:  Fix check for NULL pointer in dcdmtrmk routines

     On Linus and QNX versions a segmentation error would occur on 
     the following (incorrectly encoded ) observation.
     
     KMKG 101324Z 18022G29KT 3SM BR BKN018 24/22 A2995 RMK A02 VIS 2
  
     The VIS 2 is not correct. However, the Linus and QNX versions
     did not handle the NULL correctly at the end of the ob.  This
     was fixed.

     Change 106:  Remove Code to Decode SAO's

     The decoder will no longer SAO format.  This makes the decoder
     about 37,000 bytes smaller.

     Change 107:  Remove -oh switch

     Change 108:  New switch, -howold #

     The decoder will not begin processing a file until it is
     a certain number of seconds old.  Previously this was set at
     60 seconds.  The user can now configure this number by 
     using the -howold # switch, with the # sign in seconds.

     There is a very remote chance that two obs from the same site

     change will ensure uniqueness.

     Change 97: Add new switch '-kt'
     
     When this switch is included on the command line, the value of
     the wind speed will be in knots.  If not include, which is the
     default, the value of the wind speed will be in miles per hour.
     This switch also affects the peak wind speed (UP) and the gust (UG)
     if they are available and the UQ.  The change is for both METAR and SM obs.
     Previously, all speeds were provided in knots.  It was detected and noted by
     OH (John Roe) that wind speeds in SHEF shall be in MPH or Meters/sec.
     I have taken the liberty to include the '-kt' switch for flexibility so
     that a user can still output speeds in knots.
     
     Change 98: Include UP, UR and UG
     
     In previous versions of the decoder, the peak gust (near the time of
     the observation) was reported with a shef code of UP.  This was in error 
     and is now coded as UG.  If a peak wind speed and direction is 
     provided ( which could occur anytime during the past hour and is not
     necessarily the gust) it can be output with shef codes 'UP for peak wind'
     and 'UR or direction of the peak wind'.  
     
     Change 99: Wind Direction Changes
     
     Wind direction for UD and UR is now output in tens on degrees
     to conform with SHEF specifications.  Wind direction for UQ is
     still output in degrees.
     
     If a wind direction is reported as variable 'VRB', it is encoded
     as a 0.

     Change 94: Add Command Line Switch '-strip'

     This switch will tell the decoder to 'strip' off potentially
     'bad' ASCII codes that may have been put into the observation
     from other sources.  These sources could be local data 
     managers, the SBN from AWIPS, etc.  When the switch is not
     set (which is the default) all characters are passed as 
     is.  The character values are not actually stripped off
     but converted to blanks.

                   If ASCII value > 0 and ASCII value < 10
                   or
                   If ASCII value > 10 and ASCII value < 32
                   convert to 32.

    Change 95: Change Command Line Switch '-s' to 'sw'

    Change the command line switch that was '-s' to '-sw'.
    This allows easier identification of switches that begin
    with 's'.

                Precipitation If Missing

     If '6' and/or '7' groups report missing precipitation, e.g.,
     6//// or 7////, the decoder now sets an internal flag stating 
     that the precipitation report was missing.  The output in SHEF
     will be translated to an 'M' for the value.

     Change 84: Provide Checks for Endless While Loops

     Checks were put into all routines which have while loops.  If
     iterations of while loops are excessive, a new routine call
     metar_error_handler is called, an error message is written,
     and the program is terminated.  The file is written to the 
     'err' directory with the name 'looperr.' along with the name
     of the bad file.

     automated rain gage sites if no value is reported and there is 
     no PNO { Precipitation Not Operating } token.  The value will
     be associated with SHEF code PPH.  Remember that an automated 
     rain gage is detected when either an A01 or A02 is detected in 
     the report.  If the PNO is detected a report value of 'M' will 
     be generated. Also a check is made for either a AO1, A01, AO2 
     or A02 to determine if the automatic indicator is on.  
     This was detected by Craig Peterson at the CBRFC.

     Fix 77:  FIX ERROR ASSOCIATED WITH -pall24 SWITCH

     Fixed an obscure error associated with the -pall24 switch and 
     the PNO token.  Previously, an 'M' would not be generated if the
     PNO token was detected and the -pall24 switch was on.  The 'M'
     is now generated.  This was detected by Dave Brandon at the CBRFC.

     Fix 78: FIX ERROR ASSOCIATED WITH LIGHTNING REMARK

     Previously when a comment such as FRQ LTGCG VC or LTGCCG SE 
     occurred followed by an hourly precipitation group, e.g. P0001, the 
     precipitation group was not decoded. Actually the token that 
     followed the lighting group was not decoded.  This has been

     Fix 74: -nospeci SWITCH

     Previously, automatic stations which transmitted observations 
     other than 'on the hour', would encode the observation as a 
     'METAR' and not a 'SPECI'.  This would cause the software to 
     produce, for example, an hourly precipitation value of PPH for 
     times other than on the hour.  Now what happens, if the -nospeci 
     switch is on, all observations with times greater than 5 minutes 
     after the hour and less than 50 minutes after the hour are 
     considered in the 'SPECI' range,  and will not be decoded.

     Previously, on the 7 group (24 hr precipitation), if slash signs were

     This is important for observations that may crash the software.  
     The file is deleted before decoding, so that the file will not be 
     decoded again if the program crashes.  If the -b collectives

     Change 58 - NEW COLLECTIVES OPTION SWITCH, '-b'

     Very early versions of the decoder decoded collectives. As things
     developed, and the decoder was used operationally, upon
     occasion, an observation (or bad code) would crash the decoder. 
     The 'bad' observation would never get deleted, and the decoder would 
     endlessly try to decode the observation over and over.  To 
     eliminate this problem it was decided to read and put the first 
     observation in memory, delete the file (which may have contained many 
     observations), and then proceeded to decode the observation.  Using 
     this approach, only the first observation in any file would be decoded.  
     Collectives would not be decoded.

     A few offices have asked for the ability to decode collectives.
     I have added a new switch, '-b'.  When this switch is present
     in the command line, the decoder will attempt to decode all
     observations in the a particular file, before deleting the file.
     If you want to decode collectives, use this option.  If you
     do find that the decoder gets 'stuck' on a particular observation, 
     I and OSO would like to know about it so we could see where the 
     problem lies.

     REMEMBER THIS RULE:  When using the collective option you
     can place files of different types of observations in the 
     input queue, e.g., a file of METAR observations, a file of SM 
     observations,  a file of SAO observations (if there are any left) 
     and a file of SDO/SCD observations. HOWEVER, each individual 
     file can ONLY CONTAIN ONE TYPE OF OBSERVATIONS.  
     ( You cannot place, e.g.,  a METAR observation and an SM observation 
     in the same file and expect it to work.) 

     For more information on this Fix and problem see FIX 39.
     

     Fix 59: CORRECT ALGORITHM FOR CONVERTING C TO F 

     The algorithm for converting C to F was slightly incorrect.  
     Previously, +.5 degree was added for rounding, to all
     observations.  If the value was negative, this would make
     the readings ( slightly too warm ).  The algorithm/formula
     now used is:  F  =  ( 1.8 * C ) + 32.  If the value on the 
     left (( 1.8 * C ) + 32 ) is positive, add +.5.  If negative,
     add -.5.  This was changed both in the SM and METAR
     portions of the code.  
     Thanks to Larry Ellis at the NCRFC for pointing this out.

     Fix 60:  EXPAND STRING PATTERN SEARCH FOR SM OBSERVATIONS WITH "//"

     Previously, a SM observation that started, e.g., with the following:
     YHE 71114 174// 81005 ...
     would not be detected, because of the '//' marks in the 
     "iihvv" group.  This has been fixed.  
     
     Thanks to Tyree Wilde at the NWRFC for sleuthing this out.

     Change 61 - INCLUDE DECODING OF SDO AND SCD TYPE OBSERVATIONS

     The OH, through Ben Weiger, requested that the decoder be 
     able to handle reports received in SDO and SCD products.  For
     a description of these type of reports see "NWS Observing
     Handbook No. 7 - Surface Weather Observations and Reports - 
     PART IV - Supplementary Observations - July 1996". 

     The decoder will now detect and decode these types of 
     observations.  They must adhere to the encoding rules as stated
     in the handbook.  The present weather will be decoded if 
     detected.  The coded remarks (RMK) section will be decoded.  
     The free flowing, non decodable plain language remarks after the
     " / " will not be decoded ( Paragraph 2.2.3.6.4 ).

     Change 62 - OUTPUT PPH FOR ROUTINE OBSERVATIONS ONLY...NOT SPECIALS

     Hour precipitation will only be reported for routine reports,
     i.e., hourly reports.  PPH will not be output for SPECI type
     observations.  Previously, PPH would be transmitted for routine
     and specials. 
     Thanks to Mark Fenbers (OHRFC) for this fix/change.

     Change 63 - OUTPUT ORDER OF WX ELEMENT SYNOPTIC CODE

     Previously, if more than one weather element was reported, the
     lowest synoptic code would be the one that prints out.  In
     other words, HZ with a code of 5 would take precedence over
     heavy rain +RA with a code of 64 (see list in Fix 55). This
     was fixed so that the most important ( or first element )
     in the synoptic list would print first if multiple elements 
     existed.  ( The order in the list will take precedence.)

     The previous internal search algorithm looked for the string

     it assumed the observation was a special METAR observation.  However,
     as was found, it is possible that the token 'NOSPECI ' could
     exist within the first 30 characters of a line, and be associated
     with the observation started several lines before.  The pattern
     search was tightened up to be more restrictive, and hopefully
     alleviate this problem.

     The OHRFC ( Mark Fenbers ) requested this enhancement.
     
     The SHEF code for current weather is XW and for cloud cover is XC.  
     To turn this option on simply place XW and/or XC in the list of

     Several current weather codes can be sent with an observation.  Since
     only one code can be sent in the SHEF stream, the most important 
     weather will be encoded.  A list of the current weather tokens and the
     synoptic code is given below.  They are in order of priority.  For
     example, if a tornado { +FC } is sent along with light rain { -RA },

     was reported in the observation, a zero precipitation value
     was generated only for non-automated sites, and automated 
     stations did not get set to zero.  This was fixed.

     It was also noted that for the -pall24 option, if the -p12z option
     was not set, zero values were being generated for all times.  
     This was fixed.  If you do not use the -p12z option, only actual
     24 hour coded values transmitted in the observation will be sent.  
     For example, a 24 hour amount may be coded in the 00Z observation.  
     If one is not sent, no zero amounts are assumed or generated.  
     Zero amounts are only generated for observations ending around

     This switch was requested by the CBRFC (me).  It allows the user

     With this switch set, the type/source of the SHEF PEDTSEP will be 
     'RO' and stand for ASOS type reports, and 'RV' will stand for 
     manual reports.  For example, precipitation from an ASOS site 
     would be coded as PCIROZZ and precipitation from a non automated 
     site would be coded as PCIRVZZ. Our quality control software has 
     option to toggle on/off values from different types of sources 
     e.g., SNOTEL, ASOS, ALERT, MANUAL, LARCS, GOES/DCPs etc. This
     switch allows us to distinguish the types.

     The default, if -asosts is not present is to set the type/source
     to RZ, e.g., PCIRZZZ.

     A new optional switch has been added.  When '-round' is
     located in the command line, the observation will be rounded
     to the hour.  This switch will only apply to routine or 
     non-SPECI observations.  Routine or non special observations 
     are detected if: 

     (1) the specification METAR is located at the beginning 
         of the observation, 
     (2) no METAR or SPECI is detected in the observation.  

     If the specification SPECI is detected, the observation is a 
     special.  All special observations are required to have the 
     specification SPECI in the observation.

     When no -round switch is found, the time will be specified as is
     in the observation (default).

     Examples: With the -round switch on:

        0255Z  -> rounded to: 0300Z
        2345Z  ->             0000Z

     A new optional switch has been added. When '-fcfg filename' is located

     are required if the file is located elsewhere than the directory
     where the decoder was started.  The default is to open a file
     called 'metar.cfg' in the directory where the decoder is started.

     FIX 50 - REWORK OF THE 24 HOUR PRECIPITATION SWITCHES
     
     Please consult FIX 46 for philosophy.  The same pattern
     has been followed for the 24 hour precipitation.    
     There are three cases/options: ( CHOOSE ONLY ONE )

     The three cases for the 24 hour precipitation are:

     case 1:       no        switches ( no -p24 or -pall24 )
     case 2:      -p24       switch set on
     case 3:      -pall24    switch set on

     The rules which apply for the 6 hour methodology apply for
     the 24 hour (see FIX 46).

     Another new switch, -p12z, will only decode 24 precipitation
     reports for observations located in the window, 1140z-1310z.  
     In other words, if a 24 hour amount is send at midnight, it 
     will not get sent if this switch is on.  Only 24 hour precipitation 
     ending at 12Z would be sent.  The default is to send all 24 hour
     precipitation groups detected at any hour.

     FIX 46 - REWORK OF THE 6 HOUR PRECIPITATION SWITCHES

     Several RFC's have had questions/comments about the philosophy
     of decoding and generating 6 hourly precipitation.  My 
     philosophy is to be as flexible as possible, knowing that RFC's
     have special needs, but trying to keep within the guidelines of
     observing practices.  I have provided a new switch ( -pall6 ).
     This along with the -p6 switch and no (6 hourly ) switches 
     gives the RFCs flexibility.  Here is how it now works.

     Please note, that the following assumes that the observation
     is a regular (non special) observation and that the observation 
     falls within a six hour window. (Remember: There are no longer 
     record special type observations).

     There are three cases/options: ( CHOOSE ONLY ONE )

     case 1:       no       switches ( no -p6 or -pall6 )
     case 2:      -p6       switch set on
     case 3:      -pall6    switch set on

     case 1:       no switch(s) present ( no -p6 or -pall6 )
                   
     If no switches are set, the following will occur:
     (a) if a precipitation value is indicated, it will
         be transmitted as given,
     (b) an 'M' will be sent if the observation 
         indicates a missing value
     (No zero values will be assumed or transmitted with this option.)

     case 2:       -p6 switch set on

     If the -p6 switch is on, the following will occur:

     (a) if a precipitation value is indicated, it will
         be transmitted as given
     (b) an 'M' will be sent if the observation indicates 
         a missing value
     (c) an 'M' will be sent if the observation is 
         an automatic site and PNO is sent in the message,
     (d) a zero amount of precipitation will be sent if the
         site is an automatic site, PNO is not present, and
         no value is transmitted in the observation.

     case 3:       -pall6 switch set on

     If the -pall6 switch is on, the following will occur:

     (a) if a precipitation value is indicated, it will
         be transmitted as given
     (b) an 'M' will be sent if the observation 
         indicates a missing value
     (c) a zero amount will be transmitted in all other cases

     FIX 47 - CHECK THE PNO STATUS FOR HOURLY OBSERVATIONS

     For hourly observations, check the PNO flag.  If present,  
     transmit 'M' in the SHEF message.

     This was left in by mistake, and has been fixed.
     
     FIX 45 - '=' SIGN AT THE END OF AN OB
     
     METAR does not expect to find an '=' sign at the end of 
     the observation.  However, some stations continue to place an 
     '=' sign at the end,  and quite frequently it will be appended 
     to and considered to be part of the last token in the observation. 
     If this was the case, this token would nor previously be decoded.  
     This has been changed, and the decoder now simply replaces 
     the = sign with a blank before parsing, and the last token is decoded.

     FIX - 39 MINIMIZE CORE DUMPS FROM BAD OBSERVATIONS & OTHER REASONS
     
     Some office have reported core dumps from the decoder.  Core 
     dumps are bad and frustrating.  There are things that can be 
     done with the code in conjunction with the methodology that the
     decoder is executed.  Hopefully, the new code provided with this
     release, plus some comments about execution will help.
     
     Carl McCalla, the supporter of the METAR decoding algorithms, was
     notified of the core dump problems.  For you 'C' programmers, the
     main problems were traced to string pointers, which occurred with
     incorrect encoding  of METAR observations.  Carl supplied new code
     which is incorporated in this release.
     
     Other things were also done to minimize core dump problems.  
     Here is what happens now internally in the decoder.  The impute file
     containing the METAR message is first read from disk, and placed in
     an internal memory buffer.  The buffer is immediately written to the
     error file (before processing).  The original input file is then
     deleted from the disk.  Decoding begins.  If core problems occur, 
     the decoder could crash, however, upon the next iteration of 
     execution, it will not re-read the bad file (as was the case
     previously).  This also has the advantage that if the error file
     exists, you can trace which observations trashed the decoder.  One 
     problem with this new method is that if the message is a collective,
     only observations up to the bad observation would be decoded.  
     The rest of the message would not be decoded (small price to pay).
     
     RFCs have various ways of executing the decoder.  OHRFC, e.g., runs
     the decoder in continuous mode.  They have a script which periodically
     checks if the decoder is still executing.  If not, it is restarted.
     Other RFCs run the decoder from CRON, proc_loop, etc.  Whichever way
     you choose, I believe that this new feature of deleting the bad
     file before processing should help.
     
     FIX - 40  DO NOT PROCESS OBSERVATIONS WITH BAD DATE/TIME
     
     Some observations have been transmitted without date/times, 
     and they were decoded anyway.  observations with bad date/times 
     are not decoded and flagged with an error.
     
     Change - 41  CHANGE IN SHEF CODE IN CONFIGURATION FILE

     I you want to receive hourly temperatures, you must, in your 
     configuration file include TAIRZZ instead of TA.  These changes
     were made for METAR, SM and SAO reports.
     
     FIX - 42  3/6 HOUR PRECIPITATION PROCESSING CHANGES

     The decoder now checks the 3/6 hour precipitation remark for 
     missing indicator.  If missing is reported, the SHEF value
     will be sent as a M. If the -p6 option is set, and precipitation
     is not present, the decoder would previously send a 0.  An
     additional check is now made to see if the station is an 
     automatic site (i.e., you would expect a precipitation amount).
     If its automatic, and the p6 option is set, and not precipitation is
     reported, a 0 is transmitted.

     NOTE:  Some METAR messages are being received with an "=" sign
     at the end of the observation, e.g., T01330106=.  This could
     happen on any of the tokens, usually in the remarks section.  
     OSO has been informed of this, and will come up with a fix in a 
     future release.  For now, tokens ending with an "=" sign will not be 
     decoded.
     
     The decoder now sends out a zero for three and six hour precipitation
     groups which are included in the observation but indicate missing 
     with the '/'.  OSO has also been informed of this and will 
     probably come up with a fix in a future release.

     Change 35 - RELAX TIME CHECK FOR 'Z' IN METAR OBSERVATIONS
     
     The METAR encoding instructions call for the time in the observation
     be coded with a 'Z' at the end of the time token.  For example, 
     a time could be coded as 0150Z, or 020150Z (in this case the month
     is included).  Some stations are not placing the 'Z' at the end
     of the time.  The current version relaxes this requirement, thus,
     for example, 0150 and 020159 will now be recognized, and the 
     remainder of the observation decoded.
     
     FIX 36 - nospeci SWITCH NOW WORKS PROPERLY
     
     Version 2.5 released the '-nospeci' switch.  When a SPECI observation 
     was encountered, the decoder when into never land.  This has been
     fixed, and the -nospeci option should now work.
     
     FIX 37 - ADDITIONAL CHECKS FOR METAR OBSERVATIONS
     
     The decoder internally uses a pattern recognizing scheme to 
     Determine the type of message, i.e., METAR, SAO or SM.  Additional 
     patterns have been added to further check if the observation 
     is a METAR type.  The pattern check uses the wind group as a 
     last option for checking if the message is a METAR observation. 
     Other options are checked prior to this method.
     
     FIX 38 - REMOVAL OF ERR AND OUT FILES THAT ARE ZERO LENGTH
     
     The decoder can produce error files ( err.xxx ) and always produces
     ( out.xxx ) files.  If, for example, a file was decoded that did
     not have a recognized observation type, err and out files of zero
     length would be produced.  The decoder now checks for zero length
     files, and if found, removes them.

     FIX 31 - INTERNAL ARRAY SIZE PROBLEM

     In the function, 'extract_type', a strcpy routine was changed
     to strncpy, in order to be sure that the destination array
     would not have a string copied into it that was larger than could
     be held.  Before this fix, unpredicted things could happen.

     FIX 30 - ENDLESS LOOP PROBLEM ON METAR OBSERVATIONS ON MAX AND MIN 
              TEMPERATURES

     It was discovered that the decoder would go into an endless loop
     for METAR observations which had missing data encoded in the 
     1$$$$ or 2$$$$ groups (e.g., 1//// would put the decoder into an
     endless loop, while 14334 would not).  OSO was informed of this
     problem and provided a fix which is included within this release.

     FIX 28 - OBSERVATION DATE FOR SOME METAR OBSERVATIONS 
              INCORRECTLY COMPUTED

     Some METAR observations encode the observation day in the date/time
     group, while some do not.  The previous version of the decoder tried
     to use the day, if it was given.  On occasion, this would create 
     problems when attempting to use the system time to construct the 
     entire date.  This was especially a problem when the decoder 
     after 00Z for older observations.   The decoder now uses, as was 
     in the past, only the system date in companion with the observation 
     time.  See release notes for version 1.6.  The bottom line is to 
     be sure your system clock is set correctly and in Z.  Run the 
     decoder in near real-time, at least every hour.  Do not run the 
     decoder on observations that are older than 23 hours. 

     Thanks to Bob Corby at the WGRFC for pointing this out.  The time
     algorithm may be reworked in the future but for you should not have
     problems if you follow the guidelines above. 

     FIX 29 - DECODER GOING INTO AN ENDLESS LOOP ON CERTAIN CANADIAN 
              OBSERVATIONS AND POTENTIALLY SOME U.S. OBSERVATIONS

     The following problem is being passed on to OSO (Carl McCalla) to
     be fixed. I provided a crude temporary fix, so that the decoder
     would not go into suspension.

     Some tokens (character strings) in the RMKs sections expect/require
     digits.  For example, the token 'DUE' stands for 'dew ended some
     minutes past the hour'.  The correct encoding should be 'DUE10' or
     something like this which would indicate ending 10 minutes after 
     the hour.  I have found that the decoder will go into an endless
     loop if no ending time is specified or if the time is less than 
     two digits.  ( The exact observation that caused the problem had 
     the token word 'DUE' as part of an implied sentence in the RMK, i.e., 
     'VSBY RDCD DUE LO CLD'. This caused an endless loop. )  
     Tokens such as FZDZE also cause a problem if no time is specified.  
     This temporary fix I applied should at least keep the decoder 
     from going into never-never land.  When the permanent fix comes from 
     OSO, I'll place it in the code and notify you.

     On the previous release, the max number of files that could
     be created was 4.  This was left in by mistake during testing.

     IMPORTANT:  Release version 1.8 and possibly 1.7 had a serious 
     problem.  All of the SAOs were being time stamped with the same
     date/time.  When testing date/time features, I have the capability
     to fake out the system date/time.  I failed to comment out this 
     part of the code when the release was made.  This has been 
     changed.
     
     For those using Canadian observations, I have learned the following 
     preliminary information.  The RMKs section of the U.S. is
     different than for Canadian observations, especially for 
     precipitation.  Therefore, the METAR portion of the decoder 
     may have to be changed.  I will coordinate with the Canadians 
     and OSO to see if we can at least decode precipitation remarks. 
     The NWRFC will collect a 'bunch' of Canadian METAR observations 
     for evaluation.  The Canadians suggested that we rely upon the
     SMs for accurate precipitation data.

     Fix 24  CODED REMARKS FOR SOME CANADIAN OBSERVATIONS
     
     On at least one Canadian observation, a plain language remark
     was coded as " 241300Z". The decoder pattern matching algorithm
     thought this to be a pattern " 2$$$$", or a six hourly temperature.
     The pattern was changed to search for " 2$$$$ ".  Other coded
     remarks patterns were also changed by including a blank at the
     end of the pattern search string.

     Change 25  OH FILE NAMING OUTPUT SWITCH
     
     IMPORTANT:  The following option was included at the request of
     ABRFC.  I understand that OH will/is working on an option that
     could make this option obsolete (that is let the decoder look
     for any file in the directory irrespective of name).  Any way,
     hopefully for the short term, the option is now included.
     
     The OH SHEF decoder setup requires that SHEF products have a 
     specific naming convention.  The filename must have the following
     naming convention:  shef_prod#, where # is a number between
     1 and 999. The metar_decoder can now construct an output filename
     with this convention.  The METAR decoder will first look into the 
     output directory specified in the configuration file.  It will loop
     through numbers 1 through 999 and look for an available file.  If 
     one is found it will write the SHEF output to this file.  
     If the queue is full, the decoder will sleep for a few seconds 
     and try again.  The decoder will continue trying until a free 
     file is found.

     To use this option include the following switch in the command 
     line:  -oh 
     
     Change 26 EXPANDING THE TIME TOLERANCE WINDOW FOR 
               6 HOUR OBSERVATIONS

     The NWRFC stated that several of stations which report to them
     report between as early as 30 minutes past the hour, valid for 
     the next hour.  The time window on the SAO and METAR has been
     changed to from 40 to 30 minutes past the hour. This changed was
     made for 3 and 6 hour observations.

     Fix 22  HOURLY PRECIPITATION FOR METAR REPORTS.
  
     On previous versions hourly precipitation for METAR reports would 
     only be generated if the 'P' (precipitation) group had a value.  
     Zero reports would not be generated.  This has been changed with 
     version 1.7.  If the report is a METAR, and the report comes from an
     automated site, and the report has precipitation capabilities,
     and the observation is not a special (its a regular hourly 
     observation), and no hourly precipitation was reported, 
     then the software will generate a zero value for the hourly 
     precipitation.  This is only in effect for METAR type observations.
     
     Change 23 PROCESSING COLLECTIVES.
     On previous versions only a single observation per file was allowed.
     Version 1.7 allows for multiple observations to be included in a
     single file. The software will automatically skip over lines with
     WMO headers, ZCZC, and NNNN.  The only restriction (which should
     not be a problem) is that the collective CANNOT contain different
     types of observations (METAR, SM. SAO).  In other words you cannot
     have a METAR observation, followed by an SM or SA in the same file.  
     The collective must contain the same type of observations. However,
     you can continue to place METAR, SA and SM in different files
     as before.

     Fix 20  Time problem.  On occasion, observations will arrive with 
     observation times stamped a few minutes in the future.  Another way
     of describing this is that the observation time is greater (in the
     future) as compared to your system time, when the decoder was 
     executed.  In reality this is impossible since you can't measure 
     something before it happens.  In the computer world, where local
     system clocks could be off, these things can and do happen.  As far
     as the METAR decoder up to this point is concerned, when this happens
     the observation was timed stamped as occurring on the previous day.

     In order to minimize this problem,  a fix was provided.  The fix 
     allows for tolerance windows based on the observations and 
     system time.  The tolerance window is 1 hour.

     The following offers a few examples:

     obs time     system date/time      final obs time
     2351         2355 MAY 5, 1996      2331 May 5, 1996

     Change 21  Include a new switch, '-c'.  This switch allows the
     decoder to be executed in continuous mode, snoozing a little
     in between execution.  The number of seconds to snooze is
     a number that immediately follows the -c switch.  For example,
     '-c 15' will snooze 15 seconds between iterations.  This was
     requested by ABRFC.

             changed to 'PIT' in the SHEF encoded message.  The

             RIV $
             RIVOB $
             RIV OB $
             These are encoded using the SHEF code: HGIRGZZ.
             The user should place: HG in the 'metar.cfg' file
             to receive this data. (ARRFC)

     Fix 8   Prevailing Visibility is now extracted from SAO, SM 
             and METAR observations.  Visibility data are encoded 
             using the SHEF code: XVIRGZZ.  The visibility's are in
             statute miles.  The user should place: XV in the 
             'metar.cfg' file to receive this data.

     Fix 9   The precipitation type was previously reported using
             the SHEF code: XWIRGZZ.  This has been changed to 
             correspond to the official SHEF code: PTIRGZZ.
             (See table 17 in the SHEF documentation.)  The code
             XW has been removed.  The user should place PTIR in the
             'metar.cfg' file to receive this data.

             The codes reported are as follows:

             PTIR Code Reported    Type of Precipitation

     Fix 10  Make some minor changes in the labels that are output
             in the error files to accommodate visibility, pressure,
             pressure characteristics, etc.

     Fix 11  For METAR, SAO and SM reports add the ability to output
             Station Pressure, Sea Level Pressure, 3 hour pressure
             characteristic and the 3 hour pressure tendency. (ARRFC)

             Sea level pressure:           SHEF PEDTSEP: PLIRGZZ
             Station pressure:             SHEF PEDTSEP: PAIRGZZ
             3 hr pressure characteristic: SHEF PEDTSEP: PDIRGZZ
             3 hr pressure tendency:       SHEF PEDTSEP: PEIRGZZ

             To turn these parameters on simply enter into the 
             'metar.cfg' file the following two character combinations:

             PL   for PLIRGZZ
             PA   for PAIRGZZ
             PD   for PDIRGZZ  (This is a pseudo SHEF code.)
             PE   for PEIRGZZ  (This is a pseudo SHEF code.)

             Pseudo means that no known code exists, so I made one up.
             

     Fix 12  For SM reports, calculate precipitation for values
             990 through 999 (0 mm through 0.9 mm).  This was not done
             previously.  For 24 hour reports, translate 9999
             to a zero amount.  (NWRFC)

     Fix 13  Increase the array buffer for storing the PE codes
             as read in from the 'metar.cfg' line. The increase went
             from 81 characters to 200 characters.


     Fix 14  Hourly precipitation bug fixed in METAR decoder.  Previously
             the decoder would only pick up, e.g., 'P 0001'.  It will
             now pick up this syntax as well as 'P0001'.

     Fix 15  Previously the SAO decoder would not handle an observation
             coded as an 'RTD', e.g., XXX RTD 0445 ...etc.  This has
             been corrected. (NERFC)

             for the 'stat' function was changed to include the full
             path name. 

     Fix 2   Change the way that times for SM reports are computed.
             Since SM are synoptic observations, they will always
             occur every three hours, i.e., 00,03,06,09,12,15,18,21 Z.
             The decoder now allows for a window of time according
             to the chart below.  The algorithm grabs the system
             time when the observation is decoded.  This time is 
             entered into the table shown below and the observation

     Release Notes: 1.0

     This is the first release of the METAR decoder.  This documentation
     file will always display the most recent release notes, description 
     of fixes, and other information first.  All release notes, etc. will
     be displayed in reverse chronological order.
  
     If you are currently running the CBRFC SAO/SM decoder locally, you 
     should have little trouble implementing the METAR decoder.  If this 
     is your first time, please carefully read sections 1 through 6 on 
     installation, configuring, executing, etc.

     This version of the metar_decoder combines the capabilities to 
     Decode METAR, SAO and SM reports in one software package.  The 
     decoder will automatically detect the type of report, and call
     the appropriate decoder within the software. The decoder will 
     decode, METAR, SA, RS, SP, and SMs from manual and automatic, 
     AMOS, ASOS, RAMOS, and AWOS sites.  

     The METAR decoder is very thorough and decodes the entire message.  
     The SAO and SM decoders decodes most observed parameters, as well as 
     most coded remarks.  It also can decode many obscure plain 
     language remarks.  The decoder also decodes Canadian observations 
     ( via a command line option ).  The Canadian observations 
     and SM observations are translated into English units.

     The decoding software is only a decoder.  It does not compute
     averages, or retain memory about what happened 3, 6 or 24 hours
     earlier.  Computations, averages, etc. need to be made at the RFC 
     using the database and appropriate local applications.

     See section 7 for reporting problems, errors, or suggestions.

     You will also need to move the two header files, 'local.h' and
     'metar.h' to your directory, /usr/include.  The source from OSO 
     for the METAR portion of the code was written to look for the 
     header files in /usr/include.  This was not changed.


     All of the code and files are contained in a single compressed file
     named, 'metar.tar.Z'.  See section c below for instructions on 
     uncompressing and unTARing the file.
     
     
     The decoder has been compiled an executed under HPUX, IBM-AIX 
     QNX 4.x, and LINUX operating systems.   
     NOTE: The executable file is compiled for the HPUX environment.


     a. FTP SERV
     The code can be obtained from an FTP server set up at the CBRFC.
     FTP address:  ftp.cbrfc.gov
     Login: ftp
     pass:  < anything >
	
     cd pub/metar     < code is located in /pub/metar directory >
	

     

     b.  UNCOMPRESSING AND UNTARING
     

     FTP/get the file:                      metar.tar.Z
  
     Move the metar.tar.Z file to your directory where you keep the 
     METAR files.

     CD to the your directory where you keep the METAR files.
   
     Uncompress the files by entering:      uncompress metar.tar.Z
  
     Un_tar the files by entering:          tar -xvf metar.tar
  


---------------------------------------------------------------------
2.	LOADING
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     Move the executable program, 'metar_decode' and the configuration
     file, 'metar.cfg' to the working directory. 
     *** They must be in the same directory ***
     Any user executing the decoder must also have correct permissions.

	
---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.	CONFIGURING
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     The configuration file, 'metar.cfg' must be set up correctly for
     the decoder to operate.  It provides a flexible way for the 
     user to provide directory paths and some options to the decoder.
     DO NOT ADD EXTRA LINES to the configuration file.
	
     A typical configuration file, along with a description, is shown
     below.
	
		/tmp/queue/metar/in
		/tmp/queue/metar/out
		/tmp/queue/metar/err
		+SAOOUT

               12323 ABGA3
               .end_sm_alias


     line 1 - > /tmp/queue/metar/in
	
     The full path name of the directory where the METAR, SAO or SM files 
     are to be placed.  In most cases your LDM or AFOS product manager 
     will write files to this directory.   

     When executed, the decoder will look in this directory and 
     attempt to decode every file, until the directory is empty.
     The decoder will bypass sub-directories and files that begin 
     with a '.'.  As files are decoded, they will automatically be
     removed from the directory. 
	

     line 2 - > /tmp/queue/metar/out
	
     The full path name of the directory where the decoder will write
     the SHEF encoded output files. 
    
     These files will be encoded in SHEF, using the .A format.  Most 
     likely, you will want to write the SHEF files to the directory 
     where your SHEF decoder looks for data.  If the flag SAOOUT is 
     set to -SAOOUT, no output will be written. (see line 4).
	
     line 3 - > /tmp/queue/metar/err
	
     The full path name of the directory where the decoder will write
     any error files. (See line 5 for the ERRORFILE flag).
	
     line 4 - > -SAOOUT or +SAOOUT
	
     The two options for this line are: +SAOOUT or -SAOOUT

     +SAOOUT
     Always create a SHEF encoded output file.  
     YOU WILL WANT THIS OPTION SET TO ON OR +.
	
     -SAOOUT
     Do not create a SHEF output file.
	

     line 5 - >  +ERRORFILE or -ERRORFILE

     The errorfile contains the data message, the parsed and decoded
     elements, and the encoded SHEF message.  It also contain any 
     parsing errors.
	
     The two options for this line are:	+ERRORFILE or -ERRORFILE
     The '+ option always write an error file, even if there are no 
     errors.  Initially, you will probably want to turn this on so 
     that you can monitor if you decoder is working.  After testing, 
     you will probably want this off,  or your directory could fill 
     up fast.

     -ERRORFILE
     Only write an error file if there are errors.  
     THIS IS NORMALLY THE OPTION TO SET after initial testing.

     +ERRORFILE
     Always write error messages, even if there are no errors.
	

     line 6 - > -SHEFPASS or +SHEFPASS
	
     Leave this option set to:
     -SHEFPASS
	
     This is an internal hook that users can use to directly pass data 
     to a DB.  THIS OPTION IS CURRENTLY ONLY WORKING FOR QNX HYDROMET
     USERS. 
	

     line 7 - > desired SHEF codes and filter
	
     This line allows the user to determine which SHEF values are to
     be written to the output file.  The decoder decodes many
     values, but,  for example, it is unlikely you will use the 
     altimeter, etc.  Pick your codes from the table below.  

     USE THE CODES AS GIVEN.  

     For example, use TA for instantaneous temperature, not TAIR 
     or TAIRZZZ.  

     Another example: If you only wanted 24 HR MAX and MIN temps and 
     24 HR precipitation you would use:  

     TX TN PPD  
	
     You must have at least one blank between SHEF codes, and the 
     codes MUST BE ON ONE LINE (it does NOT have to be 80 characters
     or less).  Also see APPENDIX A.
	
     The valid PE codes and the resulting translation are:

     line 8 through 13 - > Optional names/id filter

     This is an optional filter that will tell the decoder to 
     produce output only for these ids.  Other IDs and associated
     output will be thrown out.  The '-g' switch must be set
     in the command line.
     
     The decoder will key off the EXACT phrases in the cfg file:
               
     .begin_names
     
         and
     
     .end_names
     
     The ids must be within the phrases, with one id per line.
     If you use the four character ids then you must enter the
     four characters.  If you use the -a option and strip off the 
     'k' then you can either enter the four or three character id.
     
     
     line 14 through 17 - > Optional alias id table for sm reports
     
     This is an option that tells the decoder to turn on checking of 
     an alias id table for only sm observations.  The numerical id of 
     an SM can be converted or 'aliased' to the id that exists in the 
     table.  The alias id table is read in through the cfg file 
     (see information about the cfg file).

     The decoder will key off the EXACT phrases in the cfg file:
               
       .begin_sm_alias  
     
         and
     
     .end_sm_alias

     The pair of the id and alias id must be entered between the
     phrases, with one pair per line.  The numerical id is first
     followed by the alias ID.

4.	EXECUTING
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     There are at least two ways that you can set up the decoder for 
     execution: (a) Stand Alone/Manual or (b) Automatic.
 
     a. Stand Alone
	
     Once you get the decoder loaded and configured, you may want to
     first run the decoder in manual mode.  This means that you can
     execute the decoder from a command line.  This mode is handy to
     test specific METAR/SAO/SMs that are suspect.
  
     To run the decoder in test mode at the command line simply enter:
 
         metar_decode -t -v
	
     This is the test (-t) and verbose (-v) mode.  You will be 
     prompted for a file name.  The file should contain a valid 
     METAR, SAO or SM observation preceded by a valid WMO header
     line.  The names of the ERRORFILE and OUTPUT file will be 
     provided back to you.
	
     Another option is the -d, or debug option.  You will get lots of
     stuff written to the screen with this option.  This option is used 
     for software debugging:
    
        metar_decode -t -v -d
	
     b. Automatic Mode
	
     This is the operational mode which you will want to use in 
     operations.  In order for this mode to work, you must be able 
     to automatically place/write METAR/SAO/SM products to the input 
     directory.  You then have several choices for automatically 
     executing the decoder.  You can place the decoder in a cron task, 
     and for example, execute every few minutes or hour.  
	
     An alternative option, is to use an executor which will start 
     programs on the receipt/existence of files in a directory.  The
     CBRFC has written such an executor.  This executor, called
     'proc_loop' (stands for process loop) is a multipurpose 
     executor and can be used to look in any user specified directory
     and start any program if a file is found in the directory.
     The executor looks every 5 seconds, but it can be configured by the
     user.  
	

     The command line options as of the release are:

     -?             list version number and all options
     -a             strip off the first character in the id of a 
     -b             turn on decoder to accept collectives
                    METAR observation
     -c  seconds    run decoder in continuous mode every seconds
     -d             turn on debug information
     -e             do NOT convert temps/dew points to English units
     -fcfg filename input configuration path/filename from command line
     -g             only produce shef output for ids read in the cfg file
     -howold #sec   how old a file needs to be in seconds before processing(default=15)\n",
     -i filename    provide filename from command line
     -j#            output each metar in it's own file - j1=ob + decode, j2=ob, j3=decode - no shef
     -kt            output all wind speeds in knots (default miles/hour)
     -l             switch type/source to RO for ASOS, RV for manual
     -m             assume SAO (Canadian) observations are in metric 
                    and convert to English
     -nospeci       do not decode special (SPECI) observations
     -oh            output files with the prefix shef_prod# where 
     -pall6         generate a 0 value for PPQ for 6 hour periods if 
                    precipitation group is missing for all stations
     -pall24        generate a 0 value for PPD for 24 hour periods if 
     -p24           generate a 0 value for PPD for 24 hour period if             
                    precipitation group is missing for automatic 
                    stations only generate an 'M' if the PNO flag is on
     -p1            generate a 0 value for PPH for 1 hourly periods if           
                    precipitation group is missing for automatic 
                    stations only generate an 'M' if the PNO flag is on
     -p6            generate a 0 value for PPQ for 6 hour periods if 
                    precipitation group is missing for automatic 
                    stations only generate an 'M' if the PNO flag is on
     -p12z          only decode 24 precipitation amount in the 
                    window 1140-1310Z
     -q1            output wind direction in hundreds ( default is tens )

     -round         round time to nearest whole hour for non-special 
                    observations
     -sw            switch source of PEDTSEP form 'Z' to 'V' for 
                    testing METAR
     -strip         convert bad ASCII characters to blanks
                    (1 <= # <= 999
     -salias        turn on check of alias id table for sm observations
     -t             execute test version
                    precipitation group is missing for all stations
     -v             turn on verbose option
     -w             output WMO line and ZCZC CCCNNNXXX with output
     -x #           override system ccyymmdyhrmn to the value = #\n",
     -y2k           output the century in the shef output 
        
     Example:  sao_decode -v -m -w -t -fcfg /usr/local/metar/metar.cfg 

     '-?' 
    
     This option will write to the screen a list and brief description
     of all of the options.  The decoder will not be executed.  This 
     option is used to provide the user with a quick list.

     '-v'

     The verbose option will write to the standard output (screen) 
     key information such as the observation and the SHEF output.
     This option is designed to be used in testing and evaluation.  

     '-d'

     The debug option will write to the standard output (screen)
     detailed information during the decoding process.  For example,
     the pattern matching information used by the SAO and SM decoders
     will be output.  This option is used for debugging. 
 

     '-a'

     When set, this option will strip off the first character of the
     station id in a METAR message.  For example, the id 'KPIT' in 
     the original message will be changed to 'PIT' in the SHEF message.
     The default is not to change the station id.

     'e'
     
     When set, the decoder will NOT convert temperatures and dew points
     to English units.  The default, when the switch is not present, is
     to convert to English units.

    '-g'
    
     When this switch is included on the command line the decoder will
     read in a list of ids from the configuration file.  SHEF output will
     only be produced for these ids.  All other observations will be
     tossed out.  This is entered in the cfg file.
     The decoder will key off the phrases:
     
     
     .begin_names
     
         and
     
     .end_names
     
     The ids must be within the phrases, with one id per line.
     If you use the four character ids then you must enter the
     four characters.  If you use the -a option and strip off the 
     'k' then you can either enter the four or three character id.
     
     A sample of how to include the ids in the metar.cfg file is shown below:
     
     /tmp/queue/metar/in
     /tmp/queue/metar/out 
     /tmp/queue/metar/err

     KP01
     KP06
     KIFP
     KCGZ
    .end_names
 
     '-t'

     Execute the decoder in test mode.  This mode will provide the
     user an easy way of testing individual observations. In this mode
     the user will be prompted for the name of the input file.  The
     error and output files will be generated, along with their filenames.
     For example, if the filename of the test observation was
     testdata, the error and output filenames may look like: 

         testdata.err.0203.121212
         testdata.out.0203.121212

     '-w'

     Write a ZCZC, WMO line and NNNN as part of the output file.  Some
     SHEF decoders require this information.
    
     '-i'
    
     Provide the input filename from the command line.  If you use this
     option, do not include any directory path information.  The
     decoder will append the filename to the input directory path 
     specified in the 'metar.cfg' file. An example command line
     could look like the following, "metar_decode -i my_metar_file_name".

     'q1'
     
     output wind direction in hundreds ( default is tens )
    
     '-salias'
     
     This switch tells the decoder to turn on checking of alias id table 
     for sm observations.  The numerical id of an SM can be converted
     or 'aliased' to the id that exists in the table.  The alias id table
     is read in through the cfg file (see information about the cfg file).
      
     A sample of how to include the sm alias id table in the metar.cfg 
     file is shown below:

     12123 ABCA3
     12323 ABGA3
     .end_sm_alias
      
     '-sw'
    
     This switch will tell the decoder to output 'V' for the source
     code located in the PEDTSEP instead of 'Z'.  This will only occur
     for METAR type observations, and will have no affect on SAO/SM.
     This option will allow a user to store and identify the observation
     as a METAR observation.  SAOs for the same station will be stored 
     with a 'Z'.  For example, the PEDTSEP for a PPQ received from a 
     METAR with the '-s' switch would be, PPQRVZZ.  This should make 
     it easy to identify the observations and make comparisons, etc.  
     After the METAR test is over, this switch should go away.

     'j#'
     
     No shef will be output with this mode. Filenames will be named the
     9 character PIL.
     Output each metar in it's own file - j1=ob + decode, j2=ob, j3=decode - no shef

     '-strip'

     This switch will tell the decoder to 'strip' off potentially
     'bad' ASCII codes that may have been put into the observation
     from other sources.  These sources could be local data 
     managers, the SBN from AWIPS, etc.  When the switch is not
     set (which is the default) all characters are passed as 
     is.  The character values are not actually stripped off
     but converted to blanks.

                   If ASCII vale > 0 and ASCII value < 10
                   or
                   If ASCII value > 10 and ASCII value < 32
                   convert to 32.

     '-p1'

     This option will generate a zero report for automated
     rain gage sites if no value is reported and there is no PNO 
     { Precipitation Not Operating } token.  The value will be associated with
     a PPH.  Remember that an automated rain gage is detected when either
     a A01 or A02 is detected in the report.  If the PNO is detected
     a report value of 'M' will be generated. 

     
     '-p6'

     -p6 switch set on
      If the -p6 switch is on, the following will occur:
         (a) if a precipitation value is indicated, it will
             be transmitted as given
         (b) an 'M' will be sent if the observation indicates a 
             missing value
         (c) an 'M' will be sent if the observation is an automatic site
             and PNO is sent in the message,
         (d) a zero amount of precipitation will be sent if the
             site is an automatic site, PNO is not present, and
             no value is transmitted in the observation.

     '-pall6'

     -pall6 switch set on

      If the -pall6 switch is on, the following will occur:
        (a) if a precipitation value is indicated, it will
            be transmitted as given
        (b) an 'M' will be sent if the observation indicates a missing
            value
        (c) a zero amount will be transmitted in all other cases
     
     '-p24'
    
     Same as -p6 but for 24 hour precipitation.
       
     '-pall24'

     Same as -pall6 but for 24 hour precipitation.


     '-p12z'

     Only decode 24 hour precipitation in the window 1140Z - 1310Z,
     Default is to decode 24 hour amounts for all observation times.

     
     '-m'

     When this switch is set, the decoder will assume the observation
     is a Canadian SAO, and that the data are in Metric.  Do not use
     this option when decoding U.S. SAOs or METAR observations. 

     '-c seconds'

     When this switch is set the decoder will be executed in 
     continuous mode, snoozing a little in between execution.  
     The number of seconds to snooze is a number that immediately 
     follows the -c switch.  For example, '-c 15' will snooze 15 
     seconds between iterations.  This was requested by ABRFC.

     '-oh'

     The OH SHEF decoder setup requires that SHEF products have a 
     specific naming convention.  The filename must have the following
     naming convention:  shef_prod#, where # is a number between
     1 and 999. The metar_decoder can now construct an output filename
     with this convention.  The METAR decoder will first look into the 
     output directory specified in the configuration file.  It will loop
     through numbers 1 through 999 and look for an available file.  
     If one is found it will write the SHEF output to this file.  
     If the queue is full, the decoder will sleep for a few seconds 
     and try again. The decoder will continue trying until a free
     file is found.
     
     '-howold #'

     The decoder will not begin processing a file until it is
     a certain number of seconds old.  Previously this was set at
     60 seconds.  The user can now configure this number by 
     using the -howold # switch, with the # sign in seconds.
   
     '-nospeci'

     Do not decode special observations.
     No special observations will be decoded if this switch is included.
     This applies to METAR as well as SAO observations.  For METAR 
     observations,  all hourly observations will be decoded, even it 
     they meet special criteria.  For SAO observations, 
     RS (Record Specials) will be decoded since they are on the hour.

     '-round'

     When '-round' is located in the command line, the observation will 
     be rounded to the hour.  This switch will only apply to routine or 
     non-SPECI observations.  Routine or non special observations 
     are detected if: (1) the specification METAR is located at 
     the beginning of the observation, (2) no METAR or SPECI is 
     detected in the observation.  If the specification SPECI is 
     detected, the observation is a special.  All special observations 
     are required to have the specification SPECI in the observation.

     When no -round switch is found, the time will be specified as is
     in the observation (default).

     Examples: With the -round switch on:

        0255Z  -> rounded to: 0300Z
        2345Z  ->             0000Z
        0010Z  ->             0000Z

    '-fcfg filename'

     When '-fcfg filename' is located in the command line, the decoder 
     will read in the configuration file specified in the variable 
     'filename'.  The path and filename are required if the file is 
     located elsewhere than the directory where the decoder was started.  
     The default is to open a file called 'metar.cfg' in the directory 
     where the decoder is started.

     Example:

     metar_decode -fcfg /lets/open/the/metar.cfg.file -a ...


    '-l'

     When -l is set, it allows the user to distinguish the type 
     of report, that is manual or automated (ASOS).
     With this switch set, the type/source of the SHEF PEDTSEP will be 
     'RO' and stand for ASOS type reports, and 'RV' will stand for 
     manual reports.  For example, precipitation from an ASOS site 
     would be coded as PCIROZZ and precipitation from a non automated
     site would be coded as PCIRVZZ. 

     The default, if -asosts is not present, is to set the type/source
     to RZ, e.g., PCIRZZZ.

     '-b'

     When present, the decoder will attempt to decode all observations
     in a particular file (known as a collective of observations).  The 
     observations in each file must be of the same type, e.g., 
     all METAR, all SM.

     '-x #'

     This switch is strictly used in testing, and will not be 
     used in operations.  The switch allows a user/developer to
     internally set/override the system date/time.  This switch
     will only work if the -t (test) switch is also on.		

                Allow for year, month, and day.  For example:
                -x 2000         override system year & set to 2000
                -x 200012       override year and month
                -x 20001231     override year, month and day
                -x 2000123100   override year,month, day, hour
                -x 200012311010 override year,month,day,hour,min          

     '-y2k'

    
     When present on the command line, this switch will tell the 
     decoder to output the 4 digit century/year in the SHEF
     output.  The default is to output the 2 digit year.
     
     '-kt'
     
     When present, all values of wind speeds will be in knots.  If
     the switch is not present (which is the default) wind speeds
     will be in miles/hour.

     	
---------------------------------------------------------------------
5.	METAR INPUT FILES
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     The decoder requires that the METAR input file have a WMO header
     line, followed by a valid METAR, SAO, or SM.  A few examples are
     shown in the documentation in APPENDIX B.

     The starting location of an observation is found when an official 
     WMO header line is encountered in the file.  An example of this is:
     SMUS90 CWVR 060000.  After finding a valid WMO line, the decoder
     will next search for a METAR, SAO or SM report.  You may have 
     as many observations in a file as desired, but each one must 
     be preceded by a valid WMO line.  This should not be a problem
     for most users.

     It is suggested that you do not decode collectives, but rather 
     individual observations as they are received.   

     Evidently, the OH supported SHEF parser/poster requires files
     that are to be decoded and posted to have hard-wired filenames, 
     that look like 'shef_prod.$$$', where $$$ is a number between
     1 & 999.  You will be responsible for creating these names.
     At least two alternatives exist to handle this problem, a local
     script and AFOS redirecting. 

     The NWRFC has been kind enough to supply a script which renames
     and copies MEATR/SAO/SM files to the SHEF input directory.  This
     will ensure that the files have names of shef_prod.$$$, where $$$
     is a number between 1 and 999.  If you have questions about this
     you can contact Harold Optiz at the NWRFC. The name of the script
     is 'run_sao' and is contained on the ftp server along with the
     decoder.
 
     The MARFC redirects the output files back to AFOS, which in turn
     sends them back to the LDM or AFOS product_manager.  Appropriate
     file names are then constructed within the current system. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
6.	DOCUMENTATION DESCRIPTION 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     Documentation will be posted to the FTP server/HOME PAGE as 
     changes are made. The documentation will be provided in two
     files: 

     1.  readme (file)

     The readme file will contain a chronology of documentation versions.
     You can quickly see what the most current version of the decoder. 

     2.  metar_ver$.$.doc (file)

     This file will contain all of the documentation.  Versions will
     be numbered in the filename.  An example would be
     metar_ver2.1.doc.  The first number refers to the main release, 
     the second number references minor changes/fixes. 

     As changes/fixes are being made, they will be noted at the top 
     of the documentation.  The most recent changes will always be at
     the top.  Release notes, if appropriate, will be provided. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
7.	REPORTING PROBLEMS 
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     Any problems, suggestions, etc. can be sent to the CBRFC via 
     E-MAIL.  If the problems are with the METAR portion of the 
     decoding package, they will be forwarded to the Office of Systems
     Operations, where the decoding portion of the decoder is 
     maintained.  The CBRFC will handle the SAO, SM and file system
     portion of the decoder.

     If you have any questions, problems give us a call or drop a
     message at: dgb@wasatch.cbrfc.gov 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
8.	OTHER
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     a. Time Stamping
     
 
     The date time is computed from the system time 
     in concert with the observation time.  If the system 
     time (HRMN) is greater than the observation time, 
     the YR,MO,DAY is assumed to be the system date.  
     If the system time is less than the observation time, 
     the observation YR,MO and DAY are adjusted back from
     the system date.

            For example:
               If the observation is as follows:
                   P69 SA 2349 RAMOS ....etc.
               and the system date/time is:
                   96 01 31 2359
               then
                   2359 > 2349
               and the time stamp is:
                   1996 01 31 2349.

               If the observation is as follows:
                   P69 SA 2353 RAMOS ....etc.
               and the system date/time is:
                   96 01 1 0005
               then
                   0005 < 2353
               and the time stamp is:
                   1995 12 31 2353.

     In the second case above, the decoder starts to 
     decode the observation a few minutes past the hour on the 
     next day.  Therefor you have to back the time up
     to compensate.  Leap years are checked.

     An assumption is made that the observations will be
     decoded, shortly after they arrive, usually within
     a few hours.  If you run the decoder on observations that
     are 24 hours old, you risk having incorrect date/time
     problems.
           
     Date/times are not carried in an SSM observation.  Therefore, for
     this version, the system date time will be used.

     METAR observations usually contain the day, hour and minute.

     b. File Contention

     Unfortunately, under UNIX (POSIX) there is no easy way to
     determine if a file is in use by another process.  This is
     important when running tasks automatically since you may be
     trying to decode/read a file that is still being written 
     to by another process.  UNIX does support file locking, however 
     all applications, FTP being one of them, does not support the 
     protocol.  The decoder attempts to resolve this problem by 
     making a two way check.  This first check is to decode only files 
     that are at least 1 minute old (user specified time).  The second 
     check is to measure the growth rate of the file over a one second 
     time period, and to be sure the rate is zero.  Since METAR messages
     are small, file contention should not be a problem. 
 	
     The affect on the user is that only files that are one minute or
     older will be decoded. 

     c.  IDs
     
     All station ID's in METAR observations begin with a character
     that is not part of the station id.  For example, KPIT, usually
     is referred to as PIT.  The first character can be stripped from
     the observation by using the '-a' switch.
   
     To locate the three character station ID of an SM, the decoder first
     looks for three ALPHA characters in the message.  If they are found,
     the ID is obtained.  If there is no ALPHA 3 char ID in the message,
     the ID is parsed off of the file name, i.e., the XXX in the  
     CCCNNNXXX.  The first nine characters of the SM file should be 
     the CCCNNXXX of the AFOS product. The 5 digit International ID 
     is contained in the SHEF product as a comment.

APPENDIX B - Examples
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     This appendix contains samples of the error and output files.
     There are examples for METAR, SAO and SM observations.  

     All error files are divided into three sections:
 
     (1) INPUT OBSERVATION
     The actual observation is listed.  If the '-w' option was 
     requested, the ZCZC, WMO line and NNNN will be included.

     (2) DECODED OBSERVATION, 
     The extracted elements of the observation.

     (3) ENCODED SHEF OBSERVATION. 
     The extracted elements turned into SHEF.


     All output files are in SHEF.  The observation is always included
     as a SHEF comment.  If the '-w' option was requested, the ZCZC,
     WMO line and NNNN will be included.
