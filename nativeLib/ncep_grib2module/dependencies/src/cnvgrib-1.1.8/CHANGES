cnvgrib-1.0   - August 2003 - Original version

cnvgrib-1.0.1 - October 2003 - Corrected error converting level info for
                               "depth below land surface" from GRIB1 to GRIB2.
                             - Removed statement that set GRIB1 local table
                               version to "2".

cnvgrib-1.0.2 - May 2004 - Changed Master Table Version Number from 1 to the
                           current "operational" value of 2, when converting
                           from GRIB1 to GRIB2. 
                         - Added support for Gaussian grids.
                         - Few minor bug fixes relating to:
                            1) ensemble params 191 and 192 (grib1 table ver 2)
                            2) negative pv surface values
                            3) radius of earth
                            4) # of missing values in PDS/PDT

cnvgrib-1.1.0 - January 2005 - WMO approved the JPEG2000 and PNG Data 
                               Representation Templates ( 5.40000 and 5.40010,
                               respectively ) for operational use.  The 
                               templates were assigned WMO values of 5.40 and 
                               5.41, respectively.  Changes were made to the 
                               source and to acceptable program options to 
                               recognize either template number.
                             - Added new option "-m" to support encoding of 
                               "Missing" data values within the data field when
                               using Data Representation Templates 5.2 
                               (option -p2) and 5.3 (options -p31 and -p32 ).
                               Missing value management is an alternative to
                               encoding a bitmap when using DRTs 5.2 and 5.3.
                             - Fixed bug passing null pointers to routines
                               expecting a valid target.  Thanks to Jaakko
                               Hyvatti and Portland Group.
                             - Added fix for bug that caused seg faults on some
                               systems when generating GRIB1 messages.  Thanks 
                               to Robert Shectman for this one.

cnvgrib-1.1.1 - April 2005 - Corrected the scaling factor used when converting
                             potential vorticity surface values.

cnvgrib-1.1.2 - January 2006
			- Added a new option "-nv" to cause vector quantities 
			  to be stored in individual GRIB messages versus
       			  being bundled together which is the default.

cnvgrib-1.1.4 - May 2007
			- Added a new Grid Definition Template number 204
                        - Corrected the sale factor for probabilities
                        - Added more parameters

                        - Added new local parameters conversion entries
                        - Declared the variable rmin,rmax in routine (jpcpack.f
                          and pngpack.f) with double precision to fix for bug
                          that caused seg fault on NAM tile files
                        - Added a check for the length of KPDS to determine
                          the grib is ensemble.
                        - Added new level (Nominal top of the Atmosphere

cnvgrib-1.1.7 - May 2008
                        - Add missing management value option 0 : No explicit
                          missing values included within data values
                          Note: Valid only with complex packing:
                           1. Complex packing
                           2. Complex packing and spatial differencing
cnvgrib-1.1.8 - Aug 2008
                        - Added new local parameters conversion entries
                          and table 131
