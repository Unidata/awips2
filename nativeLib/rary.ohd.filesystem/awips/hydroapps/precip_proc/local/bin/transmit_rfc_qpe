# transmit_rfc_qpe
#
# This script transmits the 1 hour MPE generated Best Estimate QPE mosaics
# over the SBN.  Normally, these QPE products will be created at an RFC
# and sent over the SBN for WFOs to use in their daily operations. These
# products are displayable through MPE Editor and Hydroview, and they
# can be used perationally in applications like the Site Specific Head Water 
# Model.
#
# This script is called by MPE Fieldgen when run from the cron and 
# MPE Editor from the Transmit Best Estimate QPE option on the MPE Control 
# menu.
# 
# The mpe_send_qpe_to_sbn token must be set to "ON" and the mpe_save_grib token
# must be set to "save" for this script to function.  Also, the section
# of this script which calls distributeProduct must be uncommented.
#
# Example of PRODUCT ID:   KALRQPEBIN
# Where NNN should be QPE
# Where XXX should be BIN
# Where CCCC should be:
#
# PACR :  APRFC
# KALR :  SERFC
# KTAR :  NERFC
# KTIR :  OHRFC
# KFWR :  WGRFC
# KKRF :  MBRFC
# KMSR :  NCRFC
# KORN :  LMRFC
# KTUA :  ABRFC
# KPTR :  NWRFC
# KRHA :  MARFC
# KRSA :  CNRFC
# KSTR :  CBRFC

# Modification History
# June 1, 2006     Bryon Lawrence                 Original Coding 
# November 8, 2006 Bryon Lawrence                 Updated to read GRIB
#                                                 files from qpe_grib_sbn
#                                                 directory.  Removed
#                                                 logic using touch file.
