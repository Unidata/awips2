# Updated March 18, 2008 to remove the call to MPE Fieldgen and error
# log information which is not used.  Also removed commented out
# call to set_hydro_env to clean up this script some more.
# Actions which need to be performed in addition to rerunning
# MPE Fieldgen can be placed in this script.  This script is
# run after MPE Fieldgen is rerun.

# This allows you to call this script from outside of ./standard/bin
