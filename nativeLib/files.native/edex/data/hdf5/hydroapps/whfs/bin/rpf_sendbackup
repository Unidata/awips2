# rpf_sendbackup
#
# version: July 06, 2006
#
# This script is used to send RiverPro product issuance info
# to other offices so that they can have the data to support RiverPro 
# product issuances in the event that they need to provide service
# backup for the source office.  This is normally executed from RiverPro.
# This script is called under two circumstances:
# 1) It is called when issuing a product.  It is called once for each
#   office to which is should send data to; so for a given Riverpro
#   product which may include forecast points with differing backup
#   office assignment, this script will be called more than once.
# 2) A site performing backup service for an office can send the info 
#   for any product it issued for that office back to the backed-up
#   office after that has is restored to service level
#
# It dumps info for the given product_id/time from the tables 
# VTECevent, FpPrevProd, TextProduct, and only rows for the forecast points
# which have a service backup relationship with the given destination
# office.  It packages this info and then sends it to the destination.
#
# 
# Usage:
#  rpf_sendbackup  product_id  product_time  wfo_source  wfo_destination
#
# where:
#   product_id   - is the official identifier for the product, whether
#                  it be the 10-character WMO id or the 9-character CRS id
#   product_time - yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
#   wfo_source       - office identifier sending data from
#   wfo_destination  - office identifier to send data to
#
#

#
# Log file discussion:
#
# when sending files to remote WFOs, the distributeProduct script is
# used.  it returns 0 for success, -1 for error. its log files are in:
#
#    ds1-xxx:/data/logs/fxa/yymmdd/dis* (where yymmdd is the date info).
#
# if not there, try looking on local workstation in:
#    ws#-xxx:/data/logs/fxa/display/ws#-xxx:0.0/yymmdd
#
# distributeProduct uses the msg_send program to actually send the
# message across the WAN.    its log files for msg_send can be found in:
#
#    /awips/ops/logs/ds1-xxx, the filenames are either
#       msgreq_svr.log for sending and 
#       msgrcv_svr.log for receiving. 
#
# Note that the locations given above are dependent upon instructions
# given in scripts outside of the WHFS control and are subject to change.
