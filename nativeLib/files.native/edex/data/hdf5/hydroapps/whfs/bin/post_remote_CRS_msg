# version:  January 30, 2002
#
# usage: post_remote_CRS_msg filename subject_string msgtype
# where the arguments are provided via the mhs receive process
# and are translated from the mhs args %ENCLOSE(1) %SUBJECT %MSGTYPE args.
#
# This script is invoked via the message handling service (MHS) mechanisms.
# It is called when a CRS product file from a remote (i.e. nonlocal) WFO
# is received at the local WFO.  This script is used so the local WFO can
# pass the file to the local CRS.  The arguments passed to this function
# are provided by the mhs receive process, and originate in the
# arguments provides on the mhs send process at the remote system.
#
# mhs places the incoming file in the directory:
#	/data/x400/mhs/msg/hydro
# transferNWR copies the file into the directory:
#	/data/fxa/workFiles/nwr/pending
#

# This allows you to run this script outside of ./standard/bin
