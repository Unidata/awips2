This document explains the general principles of using the JNI to link C libraries
and the specific requirements for linking to HDF4 and HDF5. The JNI specification
and code is standard for all platforms, but compiling and runtime linking are
different for each virtual machine and platform. These issues are complex and not
well documented.</p>

<h2>
1. Overview</h2>
These packages "wrap" the HDF libraries using the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/index.html">Java
Native Method Interface </a>(JNI). There are two wrappers, one for the
HDF4 library (JHI) and one for the HDF5 library (JHI5).

<p>It is extremely important to emphasize that <i><b>these packages are
not a pure Java implementation of the HDF libraries</b>.</i> The JHI or
JHI5 calls the same HDF libraries that are used by C or FORTRAN programs.
<p>Each Java HDF Interface consists of Java classes and dynamically linked
native libraries. The Java classes declare <i>static nativ</i>e methods,
and the library contains C functions which implement the native methods.
The C functions call the standard HDF library, which is linked as part
of the same library on most platforms.

<p>
Each Java HDF Interface is intended to be the standard interface for access
HDF files from Java programs. The JHI is a foundation upon which application
classes can be built, such as the <a href="../hdf-object/index.html">hdfobject
package</a>.

<h2>2. The Java Native Interface (JNI)</h2>
The Java language defines its own virtual machine and instruction set. This
design makes Java easy to program and very portable. &nbsp;However, Java
programs cannot use code written in any language except Java.</p><p>
In order to provide a minimal level of interoperability with other languages,
the Java Native Interface (JNI) defines a standard for invoking C and C++
subroutines as Java methods (declared 'native'). The Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
implements a platform-specific mechanism to load C or C++ libraries, and
to call the native methods on behalf of the Java programs.</p><p>
So, to access a C library from a Java program, four tasks must be completed:</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li class="li3">Declare appropriate 'native' methods in one or more Java classes</li>
  <li class="li3">Write 'glue' code for each native method to implement the JNI C or C++ standard</li>
  <li class="li3">compile the JNI glue (C or C++) to create a JNI library</li>
  <li class="li3">deploy the Java classes and the JNI library on the system</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
When the Java program runs, the JNI glue and C library must be in the 'java.library.path' path.<br>
The JNI standard defines the syntax for the Java native methods, and the
C and C++ for the glue layer. This standard is universal, the same code should
work on any platform.</p><p>
Compiling the JNI is specific to platform, compiler, and Java Virtual Machine.
The challenge is to create a C library that can be dynamically loaded by
the JVM. On each platform, specific flags must be used with the C or C++
compiler, to create a library that the Java VM can successfully load. The
same C code is used on all platforms, but the build process is different
for each platform. </p><p>
The rules for deployment are roughly standard across all platforms, i.e.,
the JNI libraries must be in the library load path for the Java application.
&nbsp;However, the precise behavior of the Java VM is not standardized and,
indeed, varies across platforms, and even different versions of a JVM on
the same platform.</p>

<h3>2.1. Design Limitations of the JNI</h3>  Mixing arbitrary C code with
the execution of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is a difficult challenge, and
the JNI necessarily has limitations.</p><p>
<strong>First</strong>, the JVM is a multi-threaded program. &nbsp;The C code in a C library will
be executed in a thread, with multiple threads active. The C code must be
thread safe, and in some cases may need to synchronize to prevent disastrous
bugs. However, <i>the</i> <i>precise requirements on the C code depend on the implementation of the specific Java VM</i>.
Not only is there no general specification for the C code, the thread-safety
requirements are different for different Java VMs--and in most cases there
is no way to know what the C code must do.&nbsp;</p><p>

<strong> Second</strong>, the JNI layer is vulnerable to errors because neither Java nor C
can check the correctness of Java-to-C interface.&nbsp; Also, any errors
in the C code can create grave and mysterious crashes in the JVM. In particular,
if the C code overwrites memory that it shouldn't, it can corrupt the state
of the JVM, producing indecipherable errors in the Java program.</p><p>

<strong>Third</strong>, the JVM dynamically links to C or C++ libraries. This process
is similar to the way that dynamic libraries are implemented for C programs,
but the <i>Java VM does not necessarily follow the same rules as the C runtime</i>.
The precise requirements on the library and behavior of the loader is specific
to the JVM, and different platforms exhibit different beharior. Furthermore,
in order to be used throught the JNI, the C library (and all its dependencies)
must be compiled and linked with very specific C compiler and linker settings.</p><p>
<h3>2.2. Resolving References in JNI libaries</h3>
The JVM is dynamically links to C or C++ libraries. This process
is similar to the way that dynamic libraries are implemented for C programs,
but the <i>Java VM does not follow the same rules as the C runtime</i>.</p><p>
The native library is linked when a native method is invoked (i.e., on demand)
or when the library is specifically invoked (i.e., the first access to the <i>ncsa.hdf.hdflib.HDFLibrary</i> or <i>ncsa.hdf.hdf5lib.H5</i> class) with a call to <i>System.loadLibrary("hdf")</i> or <i>System.loadLibrary("hdf5")</i>.
If successful, the link step is invisible to the application and user.</p><p>
This
link step will fail if:<br>
<p>
<ul class="ul">
  <li class="li3">the library is not found in the paths configured at runtime</li>
  <li class="li3">the library is not compatible with the JVM</li>
  <li class="li3">a required symbol cannot be resolved</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
If the link fails, the application will receive an exception, such as<i> java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError</i> or<br>
<i>java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError</i>.</p><p>
Note that it may be difficult to determine the cause of the link failure:
it might be a path problem, it might be a code generation problem (e.g., incompatible settings for libhdf.so), or it
might be a missing or mis-matched symbol.</p><p>
The JVM usually does not implement dependency checking and dynamic
loading for the C libraries that it loads. Specifically, if the JNI library
has unresolved symbols, e.g., to another dynamic library, the JVM may or
may not load that library. &nbsp;And if multiple C libraries with mutual dependencies
are manually loaded into the JVM, they may or may not be linked to resolve
the references in the C code. In most JVMs, these dependencies are <i>not</i>
implemented.</p><p>
Also, some JVMs check all references at load time, rejecting
the library if any &nbsp;symbols are unresolved. &nbsp;Other JVMs will load
a library with unresolved symbols, and fail only when one of the missing
symbols is referenced. In other words, the linking exception may occur differently
with different JVMs.</p><p>
<hr>
<h2>3. The HDF Libaries</h2>
The HDF Java products are built on top of the JNI, to implement native
interfaces to the HDF4 and HDF5 libraries. Essentially, there is a single Java object for the HDF4 library (<i>ncsa.hdf.hdflib.HDFLibrary</i>), with a native method for each entry point to HDF4. &nbsp;A seconf Java object (<i>ncsa.hdf.hdf5lib.H</i>5) wraps the HDF5 library.<br>
The HDF4 and HDF5 libraries
present significant challenges for the JNI. These libraries are large, complicated
C programs, with hundreds of entry points, complex arguments, C-dependent
behaviors (e.g., C subroutines with function pointers), and dependencies
on multiple external libraries. &nbsp;Because of these challenges, the HDF
JNI interface is not ideal, and can be difficult to compile, and can be difficult
to run. </p><p>
Furthermore, the HDF Native Interface is not available on some platforms
because the technical mysteries have not been successfully resolved.</p><p>
<h3>3.1. Thread Safety</h3>
The Java VM is a multi-threaded application, and therefore the HDF library
will be called from a thread in a multi-threaded program. It is far from
clear what all the implications of this fact may be, but both HDF4 and HDF5
are not thread-safe, so calls to the library should be serialized.</p><p>
The HDF5 library has a "thread safe" option (link). &nbsp;<i>This option is irrelevant for the JNI and should not be used.</i>
The HDF5 thread safe option depends on P-threads, but the JVM uses it's own
thread package, which usually isn't p-threads. More important, it is impossible
to correctly synchronize from inside the HDF5 library.</p><p>
Following the JNI specification, the recommended procedure is to use Java
synchronization to create a monitor to serialize access to the library. This
is done in the Java code by declaring the methods <i>'synchronized'.</i> This design
essentially puts a single lock around the HDF library. This is equivalent
to the HDF5 thread safe option, except it is implemented by the JVM at a higher level in the call stack.</p>
<h3>3.2. The HDF JNI Layer</h3>
The HDF4 and HDF5 libraries have hundreds of entry points, with many types
of arguments, including all numeric types, Strings, and pointers to arrays.
The HDF JNI layer must translate all parameters between Java and C, invoke
the C API, and translate return values and errors to Java.</p><p>
The overridding principle in this layer is that Java uses <i>objects,</i> and C uses <i>memory structures</i>. The memory layout of a Java object <i>cannot be accessed</i> through Java or the JNI. The translation can only be done by calling special C routines that return C data structures.<br>
The HDF JNI layer is basically a series of calls that:</p>
<p>
<ol>
  <li class="li3">translate each input parameter from Java objects to C data structures,&nbsp;</li>
  <li class="li3">call HDF,&nbsp;</li>
  <li class="li3">translate the return values from C data structures into Java objects</li>
  <li class="li3">clean up&nbsp;</li>
  <li class="li3">return.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
</p>
The translation of data between Java and C sometimes requires allocation
of memory and a copy of the data. The details depend on the implementation
of the specific JVM. In general, Arrays, Strings, and C structures are copied,
although the JVM may be able to optimize some of the copies.</p><p>
These data copies may be very significant for the HDF native interface: when
reading and writing large blocks of data, the data array may be in memory
twice (in a &nbsp;Java object and in a C array), and data may be copied between
the two copies. This can be a very serious performance penalty.</p><p>

 The C library returns error codes. The errors are detected in the JNI
layer and Java exceptions are raised. This behavior is very natural. The
calling Java program must surround the calls to the HDF libraries with appropriate
try/catch expressions. <br> The HDF libraries define a large number of constants to be used as parameters
to the API. The HDF JNI layer exports a set of Java constants that are mapped
to the required C values. The Java program calls the native method ncsa.hdf.hdf5lib.J2C
to get the correct value for the C constants.<br>
<h3>3.3. Compiling, Linking, External Dependencies</h3>
While the Java and C code is portable, the build process is platform and
JVM specific. The build process is constrained by the dynamic loading of
the JVM. For each platform, the JVM will load libraries built with certain
compilers, with certain parameters. &nbsp;In general, the library must be
a "dynamic" library, which must contain the JNI entry points (i.e., the C
implementations of the 'native' methods), along with the code to implement
the call. <br>
In the case of the HDF libraries, this means that the JNI layer, the HDF
library, and all libraries that HDF depends on must be loaded. Figure 1 gives
a sketch of the dependencies. A Java program will access HDF4 through the
class ncsa.hdf.hdflib.HDFLibrary. When this Java class is loaded, the HDF4
JNI library is loaded. This library must contain:
<p>
<ul class="ul">
  <li class="li3">the JNI entry points, one for each native method</li>
  <li class="li3">the HDF4 library (libdf, libmfhdf)</li>
  <li class="li3">the external compression required by HDF (libz, libjpeg, libsz)</li>
  <li class="li3">possibly other system libraries, e.g., libm</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Similarly, HDF5 is accessed through ncsa.hdf.hdf5lib.H5, which loads the HDF5 JNI:<br>
<ul class="ul">
<li>the JNI entry points, one for each native method</li><li>the HDF5 library (libhdf5)</li><li>the external compression required by HDF (libz, libsz)</li><li>possibly other system libraries, e.g., libm</li>
</ul>

<div align="center"><b>Figure 1. The HDF libraries and the libraries they depend on.</b><br>
</div>
<br>
In general, the Java VM will load only one library (e.g., libhdf.so). This
library must be built in a particular way, depending on the JVM. Note that
this usually means that all the dependent code must also be built conformantly.
The may or may not be possible in all cases. If one of the compenents cannot
be built, the HDF JNI cannot be supported on that platform.<br>
On windows, solaris, linux, and irix, the build procedure is to use static
version&nbsp; of the dependent libraries (libdf.a, libz.a, etc.), and then output a
shared library. E.g., for solaris the HDF4 build process is:<br>
<p>
<ol>
  <li class="li3">Build the JNI implementation classes, *.o</li>
  <li class="li3">link *.o with static libraries: libhdf.a, libmfhdf.a, libz.a, libjpeg.a, libszlib.a</li>
  <li class="li3">output a shared library, libjhdf.so</li>
</ol>
<p>
Note that it does not work to build with shared libraries: libhdf.so, etc..
The reason is that the file loaded by the JVM (libjhdf.so) must have all the
symbols resolved, it cannot require dynamic linking to other libraries. (In
other words, you have to build a dynamic library that does not depend on
any other dynamic libraries.<br>
This process is platform and compiler specific, and also very fragile. Unix
configure and make utilities will automatically detect and use shared libraries,
so care must be taken to override the default behavior. For this reason,
the HDF JNI configure requires paths to be specified for all the dependent
libraries.
<p> Note, too, that the static libraries may not be installed on every system,
  it may be necessary to re-install some of the libraries required for the HDF
  JNI, such as libz.<br>
  The HDF Java products should build and run on other platforms, but the precise process may be different. 
<p> There are two important platforms where the HDF Java products are not available.
  On HPUX,&nbsp; JVM for HPUX will load files built with one specific C++ compiler.
  HPUX does not support the C interface to JNI, and the C++ compiler will not
  link to code that was built with a C compiler. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it is
  not possible to build HDF4 or HDF5 with the required C++ compiler. &nbsp;For
  this reason, the JNI code can be built, but the HDF libraries cannot be linked
  or loaded the the JVM. <br>
  
  <br>
  On Macosx, HDF5 is supported but not HDF4. On the macosx, JNI will only link
  to '.dylib' libraries. Unfortunately, dynamic libraries are not supported
  for HDF4, so the JNI interface to HDF4 is not available. The HDF5 library
  does build a 'dylib', and the Java native interface for HDF5 can be built.
  The Java linker does not resolve all the symbols, e.g. to the libz.dylib.
  Also, the linker include full paths to the dependent library, i.e., the path
  on the system where the library is built. Care must be taken to make sure
  that all the dependent libraries are installed when the HDF native library
  is installed on a system.<br><hr>
<h3>Deployment, runtime</h3>


<p>
The Java HDF has two parts, the Java classes and the C libraries. The Java
classes are executed with a Java VM, they must be found in the CLASSPATH just as any Java classes. The C libraries
are loaded when the Java classes for the JNI are initialized. The C libraries
must be in the library search path for the JVM, e.g.,&nbsp; LD_LIBRARY_PATH. </p>

<p>
The most common problem is difficulty running the code after compilation.
This is usually caused by problems with the class path or library path. When
one of the jar files is missing from the class path, the program will encounter
a "Class not found" exception. &nbsp;An "unsatisfied link" error will occur if the library
with the native implementation is not found in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. </p>

<p>The source distribution includes two small test programs that test the link
paths (using the install directory specified in the configure). These are
in the directory test/linktest. To check the installation, change to the
directory, type 'make'. The 'testlink' program runs the TestHDF5Link.java
program, and 'testlink4' runs TestHDF5Link.java. These Java program check
the loading and invokation of the HDF library. If the link test succeeds,
the paths in the script are correct for using the Java HDF products. </p>
