<fieldset><h1>NCSA Java HDF5 Interface (JHI5) Design</h1></fieldset>
<p>
<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<p>The <b>Java HDF5 Interface (JHI5)</b> is a Java package (<b>ncsa.hdf.hdf5lib</b>)
that ``wraps'' the NCSA HDF-5 library. For general information about
HDF5 file format and library, please see: <a href="/HDF5/">/HDF5/</a>.
The JHI5 may be used by any Java application that needs to access HDF5
files. This product cannot be used in most network browsers because it
accesses the local disk using native code.
<p><b><i>What it is</i></b>
<p>A central part of the JHI5 is the Java class <b><i>ncsa.hdf.hdf5lib.H5</i></b>.
The H5<i> </i>class calls the standard (<i>i.e.</i>, `native' code) HDF5
library, with native methods for most of the HDF5 functions. In general,
there is one native method call for each function in the HDF-5 API, with
similar arguments. Consult the HDF-5 reference manual for details
of the C API. (<a href="/HDF5/doc/RM_H5Front.html">/HDF5/doc/RM_H5Front.html</a>)
<p>The Java HDF5 Interface consists of Java classes and dynamically linked
native libraries. The Java classes declare native methods, and the library
contains C functions which implement the native methods. The C functions
call the standard HDF5 library, which is linked as part of the same library
on most platforms. The Java HDF-5 Interface also translates between
Java and C arrays, and converts error codes from the HDF-5 C library to
Java Exceptions.
<p><b><i>Intended purpose</i></b>
<p>The Java HDF5 Interface is intended to be the standard interface to
access the HDF-5 library from Java programs. The JHI5 is a foundation upon
which application classes can be built. All classes that use this interface
package should interoperate easily on any platform that has HDF5 installed.
<p>It is likely that most Java programs will not want to directly call
the HDF5 library. More likely, data will be represented by Java classes
that meet the needs of the application. These classes can implement methods
to store and retrieve data from HDF5 files using the Java HDF5 library.
<p>It is important to note that, unlike serialized Java objects, files
written with the JHI5 are completely compatible with HDF-5 files in any
language. Using the JHI5, Java programs can exchange data with
C, C++, and Fortran programs.
<p><b><i>What It Isn't</i></b>
<p>It is extremely important to emphasize that <i>this product is <b>not</b>
a pure Java implementation of the HDF5 library.</i> The JHI5 calls the
same HDF5 library that is used by C or FORTRAN programs.
<p>The JHI5 is <i>not</i> a high level model of data or storage.
The JHI5 is the Java interface to the HDF-5 library API. High level
object models implemented in Java will use the JHI5 to store and retrieve
objects using HDF-5.
<p>The JHI5 is <i>not</i> a persistent object store for Java objects.
It would be possible to implement n object store with the JHI5, but the
interface does not provide any special support for storing and retrieving
Java objects.
<h3>
2. How to use the JHI5</h3>
<b><i>How it works</i></b>
<p>The JHI5 is used to call the HDF-5 library. The Java application
will make essentially the same calls as a C program. The HDF-5 library
is accessed through the Java class <b><i>ncsa.hdf.hdf5lib.H5</i></b>.
<p>For example, the HDF5 library had the function <b>H5Fopen</b> to open
an HDF5 file. The Java interface is the class <b><i>ncsa.hdf.hdf5lib.H5</i></b>,
which has a method:
<blockquote>
<pre><b>public native int H5Fopen(String name, int flags, int access_id)
 throws HDF5LibraryException, NullPointerException;</b></pre>
</blockquote>
The native method is implemented in C using the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/jni/index.html">Java
Native Method Interface </a>(JNI). The native method implementation is
written something like the following:
<blockquote>
<pre><b>JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL Java_ncsa_hdf_hdf5lib_H5_H5Fopen
 (JNIEnv *env, jclass class, jstring name, jint flags, jint access_id)
{
 hid_t status;
 char* file;
 jboolean isCopy;

 if (name == NULL) {
 /* exception -- bad argument? */
 nullArgument( env,"H5Fopen: name is NULL");
 return -1;
 }

 file = (char *)(*env)->GetStringUTFChars(env,name,&amp;isCopy);
 if (file == NULL) {
 /* exception -- out of memory? */
 JNIFatalError( env,"H5Fopen: file name not pinned");
 return -1;
 }
 status = H5Fopen(file, (unsigned) flags, (hid_t) access_id );

 (*env)->ReleaseStringUTFChars(env,name,file);
 if (status &lt; 0) {
 /* throw exception */
 libraryError(env);
 }
 return (jint)status;
}</b></pre>
</blockquote>
Note that this C function calls the HDF5 library and returns the result
appropriately.
<p>Essentially, there is one native method for each HDF5 entry point (but
please read "<a href="#DOESNT WORK">What does not work</a>", below), which
are compiled with the HDF5 library into a dynamically loaded library (<b><i>libhdf5</i></b>).
Note that, while the Java classes may be used on any platform without recompilation,
the JHI5 C library must be built for each platform.
<p><b><i>How to call it</i></b>
<p>To call the HDF5 `<b><i>H5Fopen</i></b>' function, a Java program must
import the package '<b><i>ncsa.hdf.hdf5lib.*'</i></b>, and invoke the '<b><i>H5Fopen</i></b>'
method. The Java program would look something like this:
<blockquote>
<pre><b>import ncsa.hdf.hdf5lib.*;

 /* ... */

 try { // access an HDF-5 file using the HDF-5 library
 file = H5.H5Fopen("myFile.h5",
 HDF5Constants.H5F_ACC_RDWR,
 HDF5Constants.H5P_DEFAULT);
 } catch (HDF5Exception ex) {
 System.err.println(e);
 }
 /* ... */</b></pre>
</blockquote>
The <b>H5</b> class automatically loads the native method implementations
and the HDF5 library itself.
<p><b><i>Parameter passing conventions</i></b>
<p>The Java HDF5 interface follows the HDF5 C interface as closely as possible.
However, Java does not support pass-by-reference parameters, so all parameters
that must be returned to the caller require special treatment for Java.
In general, such parameters are passed as elements of an array. For example,
to return an integer parameter, the Java native method would be declared
to use and integer array. For instance, the C function
<pre> <b>void foo( int inVar /* IN */, int *outVar /* OUT */ )</b></pre>
would be implemented in the JHI5 as:
<pre> <b>native void foo( int inVar, int []outVar )</b></pre>
where the value of '<i>outVar</i>' would be returned as '<i>outVar[0]</i>'.
<p><b><i>Data conversion and copying</i></b>
<p>The Java HDF5 Interface translates data between C data types and Java
data types. For instance, when a Java program reads a two dimensional array
of floating point numbers (<b>float [][]</b>), the HDF5 native library
actually returns an array of bytes. The Java HDF5 Interface converts this
to the correct Java object, and returns that to the calling program. This
process uses the Java Core Reflection package to discover
the dimensions and type of the array, and then calls native code routines
to convert the bytes from native (C) order to the correct Java object(s).
<p>The Java program can read and write multidimensional arrays of Java
numeric types, there is no need for the calling program to convert the
Java data types. This data conversion clearly adds overhead to the
program, and for that reason some programs may prefer to manage this conversion.
In this case, the Java program itself may convert data to and from an array
of
<b>byte</b>, which is passed directly to HDF-5.
<br>
<blockquote>
<pre><b>// the following call will read data from the HDF-5 file into the
// Java array of Float, converting from C into the appropriate Java
// objects.</b></pre>

<pre><b>Float[][] myData = new Float[100][200];</b></pre>

<pre><b>H5.H5Dread( dataset, memtype, memspace, filespace, myData );</b></pre>
</blockquote>

<p><br>The automatic conversion provided by the Java HDF-5 Interface assures
correct interoperability with any HDF-5 file from any language. If
the application program manages the conversion itself, the application
must be responsible for assuring that the bytes written will produce the
results expected when read by a C program.
<p>Some types of data must be used with care. Please see the "<a href="#MAY NOT WORK">What
may not work</a>", below.
<p><b><i>HDF-5 Constants</i></b>
<p>The HDF-5 API defines a set of constants and enumerated values.
Most of these values are available to Java programs via the class <b><i>HDF5Constants</i></b>.
In the example above, the parameters for the <b><i>H5Fopen()</i></b> call
include two numeric values, <b><i>HDFConstants.H5F_ACC_RDWR</i></b> and
<b><i>HDF5Constants.H5P_DEFAULT</i></b>.
As would be expected, these numbers correspond to the C constants <b><i>H5F_ACC_RDWR</i></b>
and <b><i>H5P_DEFAULT</i></b>.
<p>The HDF-5 API defines a set of values that describe number types and
sizes, such as <i>H5T_NATIVE_INT</i> and <i>h5size_t</i>. These values
are determined at run time by the HDF-5 C library. To support these
constants, the Java class <b><i>HDF5CDataTypes</i></b> looks up the values
when initiated. The values can be accessed as public variables of
the Java class, such as:
<pre> <b>int data_type = HDF5CDataTypes.JH5T_NATIVE_INT;</b></pre>
The Java application uses both types of constants the same way, the only
difference is that the <b><i>HDF5CDataTypes</i></b> may have different
values on different platforms.
<p><b><i>Error handling</i></b>
<p>The HDF5 error API (<a href="/HDF5/doc/RM_H5E.html">H5E</a>)
manages the behavior of the error stack in the HDF-5 library. This
API is omitted from the JHI5. Instead, errors are converted into
Java exceptions. This is totally different from the C interface, but is
very natural for Java programming.
<p>The exceptions of the JHI5 are organized as sub-classes of the class
<b><i>HDF5Exception</i></b>.
There are two subclasses of <b><i>HDF5Exception:</i></b> <b><i>HDF5LibraryException</i></b>
and <b><i>HDF5JavaException</i></b>. The sub-classes of the former
represent errors from the HDF-5 C library, while sub-classes of the latter
represent errors in the JHI5 wrapper and support code.
<p>The super-class <b><i>HDF5LibraryException</i></b> implements the method
'<b><i>printStackTrace()</i></b>', which prints out the HDF-5 error stack
as described in the HDF-5 C API <b><i>H5Eprint()</i></b>, followed by the
standard Java stack trace.<i></i> This may be used by Java exception
handlers to print out the complete error stack.
<p>For more information about JHI5 exceptions see, <a href="exceptions.html">Exceptions</a>.
<h3>
3. What definitely works</h3>
The JHI5 Interface supports the writing and reading of multi-dimensional
arrays of numbers. Any Java number type can be used (both intrinsic
and object types, i.e., both <b>float</b> and <b>Float</b>), and <b>Strings.
</b>The
Java HDF5 Interface must translate data between C data types and Java data
types and vice versa. For instance, when a Java program reads a two dimensional
array of floating point numbers (<b>float [][]</b>), the HDF5 native library
actually returns an array of bytes in C order. The Java HDF5 Interface
converts this to the correct Java object(s), and returns the Java object
to the calling program. Similarly, the Java program will pass an
array of Java numbers, which is converted to an array of bytes in correct
C order, and then passed to HDF-5.
<p>This process uses the Java Core Reflection
package
to discover the shape and type of the array, and then calls native code
routines to convert the bytes from native (C) order to the correct Java
object(s). This data conversion is invisible to the calling program,
and assures complete data compatibility with other languages. Obviously,
there may be a performance penalty imposed by this data manipulation, which
will depend on the platform and the implementation of the Java Virtual
Machine.
<p>The JHI5 supports creating HDF-5 files, creating HDF-5 Groups, Datasets,
Datatypes, and Dataspaces. Attributes can be created for Groups and
Datasets. Similarly, objects can be accessed from any HDF-5 file.
<p>The JHI5 also supports creating and accessing of arrays of compound
data types (i.e., structured records of heterogeneous data type).
Java objects and HDF-5 Compound Datatypes are not completely compatible,
but it is usually possible to map between them on a case by case basis.
See "<a href="#MAY NOT WORK">What may not work</a>", below and <a href="compound.html">Using
Compound Datatypes</a>.
<p>The JHI5 supports reading and writing selections, including hyperslabs,
repeated blocks (strides), and point selections. These work as expected
for Java arrays of any dimension and any number type. HDF-5 "chunking"
works as expected. Compression can be used, providing that the appropriate
compression libraries are linked with the HDF-5 library. (See "<a href="#MAY NOT WORK">What
may not work</a>", below.)
<h3>
<a NAME="DOESNT WORK"></a>4. What does not work</h3>
The current implementation of the Java HDF5 interface provides most of
the functions of the HDF-5 library. However, some features of HDF-5
could not be supported for Java.
<p><b><i>C function arguments</i></b>
<p>Several HDF-5 APIs require pointers to functions as parameters, through
which the user application passes a code to be called by the HDF-5 library.
This feature cannot be used by Java programs, and are omitted from the
JHI5. In a few cases, we have provided alternative methods to provide
important missing functions.
<p>The following HDF5 library calls are not implemented in Java because
they use function parameters:
<ol>
<li>
<i>H5Aiterate</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5E: All Error Interface Functions</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5Giterate</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5Zregister</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5T: application defined type conversion</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5Tset_overflow</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5Tget_overflow</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5Tregister</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5Tunregister</i></li>
</ol>
Of these routines, the most important missing feature is <b><i>H5Giterate,
</i></b>which
is the only mechanism for discovering the objects in an HDF-5 file. This
function is replaced by the utility functions, <b><i>H5Gn_members</i></b>
and <b><i>H5Gget_obj_info_idx, </i></b>which may be called from C, Fortran,
or Java. These are descibed in <a href="iterator.html">Navigating HDF-5
Groups with the Iterator</a>.
<p>The HDF-5 library supports extensions to add new compression schemes.
GZIP is provided as a standard part of the HDF-5 library, but other compression
methods may also be linked and used. To use a compression method,
a C program must "register" it with the library, passing a pointer to the
"driver" which implements the compression scheme.
<p>In the current implementation of the Java HDF Interface, there is no
way to "register" compression libraries from a Java program. The
consequence of this is that, in the event that data is compressed by a
C program with an alternative compression scheme, a Java program will not
be able to access that data.
<p><b><i>Parallel APIs</i></b>
<p>The HDF-5 parallel APIs are not implemented in the JHI5. Precisely how
MPI-IO can and should be used form Java applications is still under study.
The parallel API includes:
<ol>
<li>
<i>H5Pset_mpi</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5Pget_mpi</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5Pset_xfer</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5Pget_xfer</i></li>
</ol>

<p />
<b><i>Variable Length Array</i></b>
<p>The HDF-5 Variable Length APIs are not fully supported by
the JHI5. It is not clear how to implement these features in Java
programs. The following functions are not implemented:
<ol>
<li>
<i>H5Dvlen_reclaim</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5Pset_vlen_mem_manager</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5Pget_vlen_mem_manager</i></li>

</ol>

<p />

<b><i>Fill Value</i></b>
<p>The HDF-5 properties to control fill values are not implemented.
The functions are:
<ol>
<li>
<i>H5Pget_fill_value</i></li>

<li>
<i>H5Pset_fill_value</i></li>
</ol>

<h3>
<a NAME="MAY NOT WORK"></a>5. Warnings: What May or May Not
Work</h3>
The HDF-5 library very general and flexible, and the library is correspondingly
complex. The Java HDF5 Interface provides the key features of the
HDF-5 library, but some features are only partially supported, or must
be used with care.
<p><b><i>Strings</i></b>
<p>Java stores strings as objects, representing the string as a variable
length of Unicode characters. In the initial releases, HDF-5 supports
strings as fixed or variable length arrays of characters, and understands
how C and Fortran store strings. Additional support for strings,
including Unicode may be appear in later versions of the HDF-5 format and
library.
<p>The JHI5 attempts to map Java <b>String</b> objects to and from HDF-5
strings by converting to and from C strings (zero terminated arrays of
ASCII charters). For most purposes, this works as expected.
However, it should be realized that it is possible to write Java <b>Strings</b>
to HDF-5 in many ways--e.g., as zero-terminated arrays, as zero padded
arrays, as arrays of 16-bit Unicode characters, etc. These may or
may not be easy for a reader to realize that it is intended to be read
as a <b>String</b>, or what handling may be required. In any case, strings
written by other languages may require careful processing in order to construct
the appropriate Java <b>String</b>. For instance, strings written
from Fortran will typically be fixed length arrays of ASCII, padded with
zeros. These can be read into a Java <b>String</b> object, and the
padding can be removed by the '<i>trim()</i>' method.
<p>As a general rule, users are advised to use care when reading and writing
strings.
<p><b><i>User Defined Datatypes</i></b>
<p>The HDF-5 format and library allows applications to define almost any
kind and combination of numerical data types. For instance, user
programs can control the byte order, number of bits (e.g., 5-bit integers),
and the layout of floating point numbers. The JHI5 fully supports
these features, allowing the definition and discovery of such user defined
datatypes. However, the Java language only supports a few standard
number types, and it is up to the Java application programmer to create
appropriate object types to represent user defined datatypes, and to convert
between the stored representation and whatever Java objects are implemented.
<p><b><i>Data Types</i></b>
<p>HDF-5 allows programs to specify the storage format of data when it
is written to disk and when it is read from disk to memory, and handles
conversions as needed. The Java language itself specifies a single
standard layout for numeric data, which may be different from the "native"
machine formats. however, the Java Native Interface
converts between the 'native' machine layout and Java. For example,
the JNI routine <i>GetFloatArrayElements</i> converts a Java <b>float[]</b>
object to an appropriate C array of floats, copying and transforming the
data if necessary. (See the <a href="...">JNI</a> documentation.)
<p>As a consequence, Java programs are always writing and reading native
C data to and from the HDF-5 library. This means that the datatypes
<b><i>'H5T_NATIVE_*'
</i></b>work
essentially the same as for a C program on the same platform.
<p>Programmers should be aware that when data is read (written) the Java
HDF-5 Interface, it may actually be transformed twice: the JNI may
swap the bytes from Java to native C (native C to Java), and then the HDF-5
library may swap the bytes again from native C to the specified storage
order (storage to C). The HDF-5 library may also convert the data,
e.g., from <b>short</b> to <b>int</b> or <b>int</b> to <b>float, </b>when
such a transformation is specified. This can be confusing because
while the layout of the Java numbers is the same on all platforms, the
HDF5 Datatype is specifying the relationship between the native values
and the HDF-5 file, which depends on the platform.
<p>Fortunately, in most cases the datatypes for C can be used in Java to
get the correct results. E.g., data from a Java Integer can be written
as <b><i>'H5T_STD_32BE'</i></b>, and read back as <b><i>'H5T_NATIVE_INT'</i></b>.
This will give correct results on all platforms in either C or Java.
The one exception to this is Java <b>Long</b> and <b>long </b>integers.
These are defined to be 64-bit integers in Java, but may be different sizes
on different C environments--in fact, a 'long' is often 32-bits long.
The HDF-5 type <b><i>'H5T_NATIVE_LONG'</i></b> refers to the size and byte
order of a '<b>long</b>' according to the C compiler used at the time the
library is compiled, which is typically 32-bits.
<p>To correctly read and write Java long or Long data, the HDF-5 data type
must be <b>H5T_STD_64BE</b> or <b>H5T_STD_64LE</b>, i.e., 64-bit big endian
or little endian. Either may be selected, but an appropriate byte
order must be specified to read the data correctly. However, in the
current implementation this data cannot be read with a the C type <b>H5T_NATIVE_LONG</b>.
To read on a platform with the same byte order, the data must be read with
the same H5T type. To read on a platform with a different byte order,
the data must be read with the opposite byte order.
<br>In general, <i>64-bit data should be used with caution, and results
checked carefully to make sure that data is correct</i>.
<h4>
<i>Compound data types</i></h4>
The HDF-5 format and library support complex structured data types, including
arrays of "compound data types", i.e., arrays of structured records.
Compound data is stored as packed arrays of bytes, as C stores 'struct'
data. The Java language does not use a flat memory model; data--including
arrays--are stored as objects. An array of Java objects is not necessarily
stored as a contiguous block of storage, and contains information besides
the content of the variables. For these reasons, it is very difficult
to automatically map between HDF-5 compound data types and Java objects.
<p>The JHI5 supports defining, writing, and reading compound data in HDF-5
files through two mechanisms. First, an array of compound data can
be read or written as appropriately packed arrays of bytes. A Java
application may create an array of bytes of the appropriate size, fill
it with data to match the intended layout (i.e., as a C struct would be
laid out), and pass that to the HDF-5 library. Data may be read similarly,
and the Java application must interpret the bytes to create the intended
Java objects. <i>In this case, it is up to the Java programmer to
create the correct bytes which correspond to how the C compiler would lay
out the structure in memory.</i>
<p>Alternatively, data may be written and read by individual 'elements',
i.e., by the fields of the compound data type. For example, for an
HDF-5 compound data type with one 'int' and one 'float' element, the 'int'
data dan be read into a Java array of <b>ints</b>, and the float element
can be read into a second array of Java <b>floats</b>.
<p>See "<a href="compound.html">Using Compound Datatypes</a>" for a detailed
example.
