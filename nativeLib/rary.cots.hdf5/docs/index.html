The <b>HDF Java Products</b> include a visual tool for browsing and editing HDF 
files, a Java package providing an object-oriented interface to HDF data objects, 
and Java Native Interfaces to the standard HDF libraries. The HDF Java Products 
work with both HDF4 and HDF5 files.

       <?php include("release.html"); ?> 
	  <p />

	  <p />
	  The current version of hdf-java takes advantage of many of the improvements introduced in HDF5 Release 1.8.0. 
	  However, since it relies on the 1.6 APIs, this version of hdf-java does not include the 
      200+ APIs introduced with HDF5 1.8.0, and cannot use features that are only accessible via those APIs.

	  <p />
	  HDF5 files created with HDF5 1.8.x APIs can be opened, but objects that use new file 
      format features will not be accessible with the hdf-java products. All files and objects 
      written by teh current version of hdf-java of the hdf-java products will be readable by applications linked 
      with 1.6.x or 1.8.x versions of the HDF5 library.

	  <p />
	  <ul class="ul">
      	<lh><b>Please refer to the related HDF5 documentation for details:</b></lh>

	  </ul>

	  <p />

	  <b>Full support for HDF 1.8 will be provided in the next version of the HDF Java Products</b>. 
	  That version will: 
	  (1) Implement HDF5 Java Native (JNI5) with new HDF5 1.8 APIs. 
	  (2) Use new APIs in the hdf-java object package. 
	  (3) Add features supported by the new APIs.

<h3>Source Distribution</h3>

<p />
The <b>source distribution</b> is available from  
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/hdf-java/src">http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/hdf-java/src</a>.


<p />
The source distribution includes the Java code to build 
<a href="http://www.bigdata.org/hdf-java-html/hdfview/index.html">HDFView</a>, the 
<a href="http://www.bigdata.org/hdf-java-html/hdf-object/index.html">Java HDF 
Object Package</a>, and related HDF4 and HDF5 Object Packages. 
The source distribution also includes Java classes that declare the native 
methods for 

<a href="http://www.bigdata.org/hdf-java-html/JNI/jhi/index.html">Java HDF 
Interface (JHI)</a> and 
<a href="http://www.bigdata.org/hdf-java-html/JNI/jhi5/index.html">Java HDF5 
Interface (JHI5)</a>, and C code that implements the native methods. 


<p />
JHI requires the HDF4 library (binary) and JHI5 requires the HDF5 
library (binary), which are not included in the HDF Java Products source 
distribution. The HDF libraries can be obtained from the <A 
href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/index.html">HDF Downloads</A> page.

<p />
Building the HDF Java Products from the source distribution is not an easy 
endeavor. Refer to the following the instructions for more details: 

<ul class="ul">
  <li><a 
  href="http://www.bigdata.org/hdf-java-html/build_src_unix.html">Building from 
  source on Unix and MacOSX</a> </li> 
  <li><a 
  href="http://www.bigdata.org/hdf-java-html/build_src_windows.html">Building 
  from source on Windows</a> </li>
</ul>

<h3>Pre-Built Binaries</h3>

The <b>pre-built binaries</b> are available from  
<a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/hdf-java/bin">http://www.hdfgroup.org/ftp/HDF5/hdf-java/bin</a>.



<p />
The pre-built binaries include all of the HDF Java Products listed in the 
table above, as well as the HDF4 and HDF5 libraries required by JHI and JHI5.
Binaries are provided for <B>linux, macosx, solaris,</B> and <B>windows</B> 
in the corresponding <B>platform</B> subdirectories of the ftp site.
