<h2> 1. Introduction</h2>
<p> 
Military mission operations may involve massive data processing operations and deal with a great 
variety of heterogeneity in the types of information. This section explains 
an example use case of how the information could be conceiveably presented in HDF5. The use case is 
concerned with capturing the structure and resources attached to a sample
concept map. The concept map is an abstraction and representation of the 
pattern and flows represented by the structure and content of a set of nodes and of 
the resources associated with each node. There are three types of data 
files associated with this concept map: the raw data, 
the functional map file, and other heterogenous objects (in external files or 
links).
<p/>

<p />
The HDF5 concept map captures the structure of information (nodes) 
and resources attached to each node.  The left part of Figure 1 is a snapshot 
of the sample concept map shown in the default HDFView.
<p />
HDFView has a plugin capability that enables specialized graphical user 
interfaces (GUIs) to be created to display a file's contents in a way that 
corresponds to a particular application domain. Thus, an HDFView plugin 
GUI can be implemented to display HDF5 data in alternative ways to show how data integration 
is achieved, and also be adapted to perform simple data fusion operations. A 
demonstration of these capabilities will help illustrate the results of this 
study and in stimulating ideas for the next phase of work.
<p>
By opening the concept map, the ERDC plugin shows the concept map in a directed 
graph format that represents a notional military decision making process. Instead of showing 
a standard file based group structure as in figure 1 (left), the ERDC plugin shows the flow of 
information and relationships among the data objects, shown in figure 1 (right). The 
labeled shapes represent concepts and the arrows represent relationships (i.e. links) among 
the concepts. This concept map depicts the top-level of a decision tree process, 
where the shapes are icons representing associated resources that can take 
many forms: images, documents, websites, videos, executable software, and etc.
<p />
In figure 1 (right), the rectangle, diamond, and circle shapes represent the groups 
(or collections) of information. The leaf nodes at the bottom (oval shaped) 
link to the datasets in the raw data file. For example, the bldg_footprint 
node links to the dataset, "/Baltimore/Features/LIDAR/bldg_footprint". Other 
leaf nodes connected by dashed arrows are the links to external files/objects. 
<p/>
Links to external files/objects are represented in attributes in the concept 
map file. The links work in <MIME, URI> pairs. For example, <"MIME = 
application/vnd.ms-excel ", "URI = Situation_Weather-XLS.xls"> pair indicates 
that the URI is a link to an external Excel file. Table 1 shows all the links 
of the OCOKA concept group.

<h2> 2. Download and install the plugin</h2>
<p> 
The prebuilt binaries of the ERDC plugin will be distributed in a single 
jar file. To use the plugin, follow the instructions below.

<ol>
<li> Download and install HDFView 2.5p1 or above from ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/hdf-java/v25p3/
<li> Drop the ERDC jar file, erdc.jar, at $HDFView_HOME/lib/ext
<li> Open HDFView and select the erdc.TreeViewERDC and erdc.ImageViewERDC as the default TreeView and 
     ImageView from "Tools" -> "User Options" -> "Default Module".
<li> Restart HDFView
</ol>

<a name=files></a>
<h2> 3. Testing files</h2>
You will need the following files to run the plugin demonstration. All the files must be in the same directory.
<ol>
<li> concept_map_demo.h5 (10KB) - the concept map
<li> URBAN_ATO.h5 (1.3GB) - the raw data
<li> Recon_Immersive-Video.avi (9MB) - demo video file
<li> Events_Intel-Report.pdf (224KB) - demo pdf file
<li> Situation_Weather-XLS.xls (249KB) - demo Excel spreadsheet
</ol>

<a name=browse></a>
<h2> 4. Browse through the concept map</h2>
<p>
After you open the concept map file, concept_map_demo.h5, you will see
the map structure on the left side and the base image on the right side.
<p>
<table border="1">

<tr><td><img src="snapshot_plugin.gif"></img></td></tr>
</table>


<h3> Nodes and links</h3>
<p>
Internal nodes (green rectangle, orange diamond, and grey circle) represent
groups in the concept map file. Links (solid or dashed) represent connections
and/or associations amongst the objects.

<p> 
Right-mouse click on an internal node/link to show the information about the node/link.
You can also drag the mouse to move nodes to a different location.

<h3> Open data content</h3>
<p>
The bottom leaf nodes are linked to datasets in the raw data file, URBAN_ATO.h5.
Right-mouse click on a leaf node to view the content of the dataset in table or image.

<p>
Right-mouse click external leaf nodes, such as video, excel, or pdf, to open the
the content of the external file.

<a name=edit></a>
<h2> 5. Add a new node </h2>
<p>
To interactively create a new node (object), click on an icon in the toolbar and select a location where the 
new item is to be added. 

<p>
Double click on the new object to change its name.
Use the mouse-drag to move the new object to a different location.
