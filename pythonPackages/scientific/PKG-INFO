Description: ScientificPython is a collection of Python modules that are useful
        for scientific computing. In this collection you will find modules
        that cover basic geometry (vectors, tensors, transformations, vector
        and tensor fields), quaternions, automatic derivatives, (linear)
        interpolation, polynomials, elementary statistics, nonlinear
        least-squares fits, unit calculations, Fortran-compatible text
        formatting, 3D visualization via VRML, and two Tk widgets for simple
        line plots and 3D wireframe models.
