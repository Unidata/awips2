# This class is a dummy implementation of the 
# org.locationtech.jts.geom.Envelope class. It was simply created to allow
# serialization/deserialization of IDataRequest objects from the Data Access
# Framework. This should be re-implemented if useful work needs to be 
# performed against serialized Envelope objects.
