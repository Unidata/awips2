    # How to call this constructor:
    #   1. Pass in all arguments separately (e.g., 
    #      ThriftClient.ThriftClient("localhost", 9581, "/services"))
    #      will return a Thrift client pointed at http://localhost:9581/services.
    #   2. Pass in all arguments through the host string (e.g., 
    #      ThriftClient.ThriftClient("localhost:9581/services"))
    #      will return a Thrift client pointed at http://localhost:9581/services.
    #   3. Pass in host/port arguments through the host string (e.g., 
    #      ThriftClient.ThriftClient("localhost:9581", "/services"))
    #      will return a Thrift client pointed at http://localhost:9581/services.
