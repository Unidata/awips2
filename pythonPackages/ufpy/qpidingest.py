#       ***EDEX and QPID must be running for this module to work***
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This module is used to connect to QPID and send messages to the external.dropbox queue
# which tells EDEX to ingest a data file from a specified path. This avoids having to copy
# a data file into an endpoint. Each message also contains a header which is used to determine
# which plugin should be used to decode the file. Each plugin has an xml file located in
# $EDEX_HOME/data/utility/edex_static/base/distribution that contains regular expressions
# that the header is compared to. When the header matches one of these regular expressions
# the file is decoded with that plugin. If you make changes to one of these xml files you
# must restart EDEX for the changes to take effect.
#
# NOTE: If the message is being sent but you do not see it being ingested in the EDEX log
# check the xml files to make sure the header you are passing matches one of the regular
# expressions. Beware of spaces, some regular expressions require spaces while others use
# a wildcard character so a space is optional. It seems you are better off having the space
# as this will be matched to both patterns. For the file in the example below,
# 20100218_185755_SAUS46KLOX.metar, I use SAUS46 KLOX as the header to make sure it matches.
#
#
# EXAMPLE:
# Simple example program:
#
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# import qpidingest
# #Tell EDEX to ingest a metar file from data_store. The filepath is
# #/awips2/data_store/20100218/metar/00/standard/20100218_005920_SAUS46KSEW.metar
#
# conn=qpidingest.IngestViaQPID() #defaults to localhost port 5672
#
# #If EDEX is not on the local machine you can make the connection as follows
# #conn=qpidingest.IngestViaQPID(host='<MACHINE NAME>',port=<PORT NUMBER>)
#
# conn.sendmessage('/awips2/data_store/20100218/metar/18/standard/20100218_185755_SAUS46KLOX.metar','SAUS46 KLOX')
# conn.close()
