                          LDM README FILE

INTRODUCTION:

    This package contains the source-code for the Unidata Program
    Center's Local Data Manager (LDM).

RELEASE IDENTIFICATION:

    The release identifier for this package is in the file VERSION and
    has the following form:

        <major>.<minor>.<rev>

    where:

        <major>     Is the major release-number (e.g., 6).  Changes
                    to this component indicate a major departure from
                    previous releases (such as a change to the LDM
                    protocol).  Such changes are often not compatible
                    with previous releases.

        <minor>     Is the minor release-number (e.g., 1).  Changes
                    to this component indicate the addition of
                    new features.  The package remains compatible
                    with previous releases having the same major
                    release-number.

        <rev>       Is the revision-level (e.g., 0).  Changes to this
                    component indicate bug-fixes and/or performance
                    improvments that are functionally compatible with
                    previous releases having the same major and minor
                    release-numbers.
