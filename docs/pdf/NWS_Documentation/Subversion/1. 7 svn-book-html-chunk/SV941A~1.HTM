      </div>
      <p>At some point, you're going to need to understand how your
      Subversion client communicates with its server.  Subversion's
      networking layer is abstracted, meaning that Subversion clients
      exhibit the same general behaviors no matter what sort of server
      they are operating against.  Whether speaking the HTTP protocol
      (<code class="literal">http://</code>) with the Apache HTTP Server or
      speaking the custom Subversion protocol
      (<code class="literal">svn://</code>) with <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>,
      the basic network model is the same.  In this section, we'll
      explain the basics of that network model, including how
      Subversion manages authentication and authorization
      matters.</p>
      <div class="sect2" title="Requests and Responses">
        <div class="titlepage">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The Subversion client spends most of its time managing
        working copies.  When it needs information from a remote
        repository, however, it makes a network request, and the
        server responds with an appropriate answer.  The details of
        the network protocol are hidden from the user—the client
        attempts to access a URL, and depending on the URL scheme, a
        particular protocol is used to contact the server (see <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.advanced.reposurls" title="Addressing the Repository">the section called “Addressing the Repository”</a>).</p>

          URL schemes and protocols the client knows how to use.</p>

          </table>
        </div>
        <p>When the server process receives a client request, it
        often demands that the client identify itself.  It issues
        an authentication challenge to the client, and the client
        responds by providing <em class="firstterm">credentials</em> back
        to the server.  Once authentication is complete, the server
        responds with the original information that the client asked for.
        Notice that this system is different from systems such as CVS,
        where the client preemptively offers credentials (<span class="quote">“<span class="quote">logs
        in</span>”</span>) to the server before ever making a request.  In
        Subversion, the server <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pulls</span>”</span> credentials by
        challenging the client at the appropriate moment, rather than
        the client <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pushing</span>”</span> them.  This makes certain
        operations more elegant.  For example, if a server is
        configured to allow anyone in the world to read a repository,
        the server will never issue an authentication challenge
        when a client attempts to <span class="command"><strong>svn checkout</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>If the particular network requests issued by the client
        result in a new revision being created in the repository
        (e.g., <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>), Subversion uses the
        authenticated username associated with those requests as the
        author of the revision.  That is, the authenticated user's
        name is stored as the value of the
        <code class="literal">svn:author</code> property on the new revision
        (see <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.properties.html" title="Subversion Properties">the section called “Subversion Properties”</a>).  If
        the client was not authenticated (i.e., if the server
        never issued an authentication challenge), the revision's
        <code class="literal">svn:author</code> property is empty.

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Many Subversion servers are configured to require
        authentication.  Sometimes anonymous read operations are
        allowed, while write operations must be authenticated.  In
        other cases, reads and writes alike require authentication.
        Subversion's different server options understand different
        authentication protocols, but from the user's point of view,
        authentication typically boils down to usernames and
        passwords.  Subversion clients offer several different ways to
        retrieve and store a user's authentication credentials, from
        interactive prompting for usernames and passwords to encrypted
        and non-encrypted on-disk data caches.</p>
        <p>The security-conscious reader will suspect immediately
        that there is reason for concern here.  <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Caching
        passwords on disk?  That's terrible!  You should never do
        that!</span>”</span>  Don't worry—it's not as bad as it sounds.
        The following sections discuss the various types of credential
        caches that Subversion uses, when it uses them, and how to
        disable that functionality in whole or in part.</p>
        <div class="sect3" title="Caching credentials">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache"></a>Caching credentials</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Subversion offers a remedy for the annoyance caused when
          users are forced to type their usernames and passwords over
          and over again.  By default, whenever the command-line
          client successfully responds to a server's authentication
          challenge, credentials are cached on disk and keyed on a
          combination of the server's hostname, port, and
          authentication realm.  This cache will then be automatically
          consulted in the future, avoiding the need for the user to
          re-type his or her authentication credentials.  If seemingly
          suitable credentials are not present in the cache, or if the
          cached credentials ultimately fail to authenticate, the
          client will, by default, fall back to prompting the user for
          the necessary information.</p>
          <p>The Subversion developers recognize that on-disk caches
          of authentication credentials can be a security risk.  To
          offset this, Subversion works with available mechanisms
          provided by the operating system and environment to try to
          minimize the risk of leaking this information.</p>

              <li class="listitem">
                <p>On Windows, the Subversion client stores passwords
              in the <code class="filename">%APPDATA%/Subversion/auth/</code>
              directory.  On Windows 2000 and later, the standard
              Windows cryptography services are used to encrypt the
              password on disk.  Because the encryption key is managed
              by Windows and is tied to the user's own login
              credentials, only the user can decrypt the cached
              password.  (Note that if the user's Windows account
              password is reset by an administrator, all of the cached
              passwords become undecipherable.  The Subversion client
              will behave as though they don't exist, prompting for
              passwords when required.)</p>

              <li class="listitem">
                <p>Similarly, on Mac OS X, the Subversion client stores
              all repository passwords in the login keyring (managed
              by the Keychain service), which is protected by the
              user's account password.  User preference settings can
              impose additional policies, such as requiring that the
              user's account password be entered each time the
              Subversion password is used.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>For other Unix-like operating systems, no single
              standard <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">keychain</span>”</span> service exists.
              However, the Subversion client knows how to store
              passwords securely using the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">GNOME Keyring</span>”</span>
              and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">KDE Wallet</span>”</span> services.  Also, before
              storing unencrypted passwords in the
              <code class="filename">~/.subversion/auth/</code> caching area,
              the Subversion client will ask the user for permission
              to do so.  Note that the <code class="filename">auth/</code>
              caching area is still permission-protected so that only
              the user (owner) can read data from it, not the world at
              large.  The operating system's own file permissions protect
              the passwords from other non-administrative users on the
              same system, provided they have no direct physical access
              to the storage media of the home directory, or backups
              thereof.</p>

          <p>Of course, for the truly paranoid, none of these
          mechanisms meets the test of perfection.  So for those folks
          willing to sacrifice convenience for the ultimate in security,
          Subversion provides various ways of disabling its credentials
          caching system altogether.</p>

          <p>When you perform a Subversion operation that requires
          you to authenticate, by default Subversion tries to cache
          your authentication credentials on disk in encrypted form.
          On some systems, Subversion may be unable to encrypt your
          authentication data.  In those situations, Subversion will
          ask whether you want to cache your credentials to disk in
          plaintext:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout https://host.example.com:443/svn/private-repo
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
ATTENTION!  Your password for authentication realm:

   &lt;https://host.example.com:443&gt; Subversion Repository

can only be stored to disk unencrypted!  You are advised to configure
your system so that Subversion can store passwords encrypted, if
possible.  See the documentation for details.

You can avoid future appearances of this warning by setting the value
of the 'store-plaintext-passwords' option to either 'yes' or 'no' in
'/tmp/servers'.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Store password unencrypted (yes/no)? 
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>If you want the convenience of not having to continually
          reenter your password for future operations, you can
          answer <code class="literal">yes</code> to this prompt.  If you're
          concerned about caching your Subversion passwords in
          plaintext and do not want to be asked about it again and
          again, you can disable caching of plaintext passwords either
          permanently, or on a server-per-server basis.</p>

          share a login to the system, but each have distinct
          Subversion identities.  You can omit
          the <code class="option">--password</code> option from this pair if

          <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> automatically send credentials to the
          server.  As discussed earlier, the server <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pulls</span>”</span>
          credentials from the client when it deems necessary; the
          client cannot <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">push</span>”</span> them at will.  If a username
          and/or password are passed as options, they will be
          presented to the server only if the server requests them.  These
          options are typically used to authenticate as a different user
          than Subversion would have chosen by default (such as your
          system login name) or when trying to avoid interactive
          prompting (such as when calling <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> from a
          script).</p>

                  <p>A common mistake is to misconfigure a server so
            that it never issues an authentication challenge.  When
            users pass <code class="option">--username</code> and
            <code class="option">--password</code> options to the client, they're
            surprised to see that they're never used; that is, new
            revisions still appear to have been committed
            anonymously!</p>

          <p>Here is a final summary that describes how a Subversion
          client behaves when it receives an authentication
          challenge.</p>
          <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>First, the client checks whether the user specified
              any credentials as command-line options
              (<code class="option">--username</code> and/or
              <code class="option">--password</code>).  If so, the client will try
              to use those credentials to authenticate against the
              server.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>If no command-line credentials were provided, or the
              provided ones were invalid, the client looks up the server's
              hostname, port, and realm in the runtime configuration's
              <code class="filename">auth/</code> area, to see whether appropriate 
              credentials are cached there.  If so, it attempts to use
              those credentials to authenticate.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p>Finally, if the previous mechanisms failed to
              successfully authenticate the user against the server, the
              client resorts to interactively prompting the user for
              valid credentials (unless instructed not to do so via the
              <code class="option">--non-interactive</code> option or its
              client-specific equivalents).</p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>If the client successfully authenticates by any of these
          methods, it will attempt to cache the credentials on disk
          (unless the user has disabled this behavior, as mentioned
          earlier).</p>
