          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Subversion has the ability to substitute
      <em class="firstterm">keywords</em>—pieces of useful,
      dynamic information about a versioned file—into the
      contents of the file itself.  Keywords generally provide
      information about the last modification made to the file.
      Because this information changes each time the
      file changes, and more importantly, just
      <span class="emphasis"><em>after</em></span> the file changes, it is a hassle
      for any process except the version control system to keep
      the data completely up to date.  Left to human authors, the
      information would inevitably grow stale.</p>
      <p>For example, say you have a document in which you would
      like to display the last date on which it was modified.  You
      could burden every author of that document to, just before
      committing their changes, also tweak the part of the
      document that describes when it was last changed.  But
      sooner or later, someone would forget to do that.  Instead,
      simply ask Subversion to perform keyword substitution on the
      <code class="literal">LastChangedDate</code> keyword.  You control
      where the keyword is inserted into your document by placing
      a <em class="firstterm">keyword anchor</em> at the desired
      location in the file.  This anchor is just a string of text
      formatted as
      <code class="literal">$</code><em class="replaceable"><code>KeywordName</code></em><code class="literal">$</code>.</p>
      <p>All keywords are case-sensitive where they appear as
      anchors in files: you must use the correct capitalization
      for the keyword to be expanded.  You should consider the
      value of the <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> property to be
      case-sensitive, too—certain keyword names will be recognized
      regardless of case, but this behavior is deprecated.</p>
      <p>Subversion defines the list of keywords available for
      substitution.  That list contains the following five keywords, 
      some of which have aliases that you can also use:</p>
      <div class="variablelist">
        <dl>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">
              <code class="literal">Date</code>
            </span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This keyword describes the last time the file was
            known to have been changed in the repository, and is of
            the form <code class="literal">$Date: 2006-07-22 21:42:37 -0700 (Sat,
            22 Jul 2006) $</code>.  It may also be specified as
            <code class="literal">LastChangedDate</code>.  Unlike the
            <code class="literal">Id</code> keyword, which uses UTC, the
            <code class="literal">Date</code> keyword displays dates using the
            local time zone.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">
              <code class="literal">Revision</code>
            </span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This keyword describes the last known revision in
            which this file changed in the repository, and looks
            something like <code class="literal">$Revision: 144 $</code>.  
            It may also be specified as
            <code class="literal">LastChangedRevision</code> or
            <code class="literal">Rev</code>.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">

            </span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This keyword describes the last known user to
            change this file in the repository, and looks
            something like <code class="literal">$Author: harry $</code>.  
            It may also be specified as 
            <code class="literal">LastChangedBy</code>.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">
              <code class="literal">HeadURL</code>
            </span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This keyword describes the full URL to the latest
            version of the file in the repository, and looks
            something like <code class="literal">$HeadURL:
            http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk/calc.c $</code>.
            It may be abbreviated as
            <code class="literal">URL</code>.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">

            </span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This keyword is a compressed combination of the other
            keywords.  Its substitution looks something like
            <code class="literal">$Id: calc.c 148 2006-07-28 21:30:43Z sally
            $</code>, and is interpreted to mean that the file
            <code class="filename">calc.c</code> was last changed in revision
            148 on the evening of July 28, 2006 by the user
            <code class="literal">sally</code>.  The date displayed by this
            keyword is in UTC, unlike that of the
            <code class="literal">Date</code> keyword (which uses the local time
            zone).</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <span class="term">
              <code class="literal">Header</code>
            </span>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <p>This keyword is similar to the <code class="literal">Id</code>
            keyword but contains the full URL of the latest revision
            of the item, identical to <code class="literal">HeadURL</code>. 
            Its substitution looks something like <code class="literal">$Header: 
            http://svn.example.com/repos/trunk/calc.c 
            148 2006-07-28 21:30:43Z sally $</code>.
          </p>
          </dd>
        </dl>
      </div>
      <p>Several of the preceding descriptions use the phrase
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">last known</span>”</span> or similar wording.  Keep in mind that
      keyword expansion is a client-side operation, and your client
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">knows</span>”</span> only about changes that have occurred in
      the repository when you update your working copy to include
      those changes.  If you never update your working copy, your
      keywords will never expand to different values even if those
      versioned files are being changed regularly in the
      repository.</p>
      <p>Simply adding keyword anchor text to your file does nothing
      special.  Subversion will never attempt to perform textual
      substitutions on your file contents unless explicitly asked to
      do so.  After all, you might be writing a
      document<sup>[<a id="idp34391824" href="#ftn.idp34391824" class="footnote">17</a>]</sup> about how to use keywords, and
      you don't want Subversion to substitute your beautiful examples
      of unsubstituted keyword anchors!</p>
      <p>To tell Subversion whether to substitute keywords
      on a particular file, we again turn to the property-related
      subcommands.  The <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> property,
      when set on a versioned file, controls which keywords will
      be substituted on that file.  The value is a space-delimited
      list of keyword names or aliases.</p>
      <p>For example, say you have a versioned file named
      <code class="filename">weather.txt</code> that looks like
      this:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting">
Here is the latest report from the front lines.
$LastChangedDate$
$Rev$
Cumulus clouds are appearing more frequently as summer approaches.
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>With no <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> property set on
      that file, Subversion will do nothing special.  Now, let's
      enable substitution of the
      <code class="literal">LastChangedDate</code> keyword.</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn propset svn:keywords "Date Author" weather.txt
property 'svn:keywords' set on 'weather.txt'
$
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Now you have made a local property modification on the
      <code class="filename">weather.txt</code> file.  You will see no
      changes to the file's contents (unless you made some of your
      own prior to setting the property).  Notice that the file
      contained a keyword anchor for the <code class="literal">Rev</code>
      keyword, yet we did not include that keyword in the property
      value we set.  Subversion will happily ignore requests to
      substitute keywords that are not present in the file and
      will not substitute keywords that are not present in the
      <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code> property value.</p>
      <p>Immediately after you commit this property change,
      Subversion will update your working file with the new
      substitute text.  Instead of seeing your keyword anchor
      <code class="literal">$LastChangedDate$</code>, you'll see its
      substituted result.  That result also contains the name of
      the keyword and continues to be delimited by the dollar sign
      (<code class="literal">$</code>) characters.  And as we predicted, the
      <code class="literal">Rev</code> keyword was not substituted because
      we didn't ask for it to be.</p>
      <p>Note also that we set the <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code>
      property to <code class="literal">Date Author</code>, yet the keyword
      anchor used the alias <code class="literal">$LastChangedDate$</code>
      and still expanded correctly:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
Here is the latest report from the front lines.
$LastChangedDate: 2006-07-22 21:42:37 -0700 (Sat, 22 Jul 2006) $
$Rev$
Cumulus clouds are appearing more frequently as summer approaches.
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>If someone else now commits a change to
      <code class="filename">weather.txt</code>, your copy of that file
      will continue to display the same substituted keyword value
      as before—until you update your working copy.  At that
      time, the keywords in your <code class="filename">weather.txt</code>
      file will be resubstituted with information that
      reflects the most recent known commit to that file.</p>
      <div class="sidebar" title="Where's $GlobalRev$?">
        <p class="title">
          <b>Where's $GlobalRev$?</b>
        </p>
        <p>New users are often confused by how the
        <code class="literal">$Rev$</code> keyword works.  Since the repository
        has a single, globally increasing revision number, many people
        assume that it is this number that is reflected by the
        <code class="literal">$Rev$</code> keyword's value.  But
        <code class="literal">$Rev$</code> expands to show the last revision in
        which the file <span class="emphasis"><em>changed</em></span>, not the last
        revision to which it was updated.  Understanding this clears
        the confusion, but frustration often remains—without the
        support of a Subversion keyword to do so, how can you
        automatically get the global revision number into your
        files?</p>
        <p>To do this, you need external processing.  Subversion
        ships with a tool called <span class="command"><strong>svnversion</strong></span>, which
        was designed for just this purpose.  It crawls your working
        copy and generates as output the revision(s) it finds.  You
        can use this program, plus some additional tooling, to embed
        that revision information into your files.  For more
        information on <span class="command"><strong>svnversion</strong></span>, see <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.svnversion.html" title="svnversion—Subversion Working Copy Version Info">the section called “svnversion—Subversion Working Copy Version Info”</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <p>You can also instruct Subversion to maintain a fixed length
      (in terms of the number of bytes consumed) for the substituted
      keyword.  By using a double colon (<code class="literal">::</code>) after
      the keyword name, followed by a number of space characters, you
      define that fixed width.  When Subversion goes to substitute
      your keyword for the keyword and its value, it will essentially
      replace only those space characters, leaving the overall width
      of the keyword field unchanged.  If the substituted value is
      shorter than the defined field width, there will be extra
      padding characters (spaces) at the end of the substituted field;
      if it is too long, it is truncated with a special hash
      (<code class="literal">#</code>) character just before the final dollar
      sign terminator.</p>
      <p>For example, say you have a document in which you have
      some section of tabular data reflecting the document's
      Subversion keywords.  Using the original Subversion keyword
      substitution syntax, your file might look something
      like:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$Rev$:     Revision of last commit
$Author$:  Author of last commit
$Date$:    Date of last commit
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Now, that looks nice and tabular at the start of things.
      But when you then commit that file (with keyword substitution
      enabled, of course), you see:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$Rev: 12 $:     Revision of last commit
$Author: harry $:  Author of last commit
$Date: 2006-03-15 02:33:03 -0500 (Wed, 15 Mar 2006) $:    Date of last commit
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The result is not so beautiful.  And you might be
      tempted to then adjust the file after the substitution so
      that it again looks tabular.  But that holds only as long as
      the keyword values are the same width.  If the last
      committed revision rolls into a new place value (say, from
      99 to 100), or if another person with a longer username
      commits the file, stuff gets all crooked again.  However, if
      you are using Subversion 1.2 or later, you can use the new
      fixed-length keyword syntax and define some field widths that
      seem sane, so your file might look like this:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$Rev::               $:  Revision of last commit
$Author::            $:  Author of last commit
$Date::              $:  Date of last commit
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>You commit this change to your file.  This time,
      Subversion notices the new fixed-length keyword syntax and
      maintains the width of the fields as defined by the padding
      you placed between the double colon and the trailing dollar
      sign.  After substitution, the width of the fields is
      completely unchanged—the short values for
      <code class="literal">Rev</code> and <code class="literal">Author</code> are
      padded with spaces, and the long <code class="literal">Date</code>
      field is truncated by a hash character:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$Rev:: 13            $:  Revision of last commit
$Author:: harry      $:  Author of last commit
$Date:: 2006-03-15 0#$:  Date of last commit
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>The use of fixed-length keywords is especially handy when
      performing substitutions into complex file formats that
      themselves use fixed-length fields for data, or for which the
      stored size of a given data field is overbearingly difficult to
      modify from outside the format's native application (as is true
      for the older Microsoft Office document formats).</p>

              <p>Subversion will only perform keyword substitution on files
        that it considers to be human-readable—this is, files
        which don't carry an <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property
        whose value indicates otherwise.  To force keyword
        substitution on binary files, you'll need to either lie or
        feign ignorance about their true content type.  Understand,
        however, that doing so will also enable for those files other
        Subversion behaviors that you might not desire, including
        line-based differencing and merging.  For more about content
        types, see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="File Content Type">the section called “File Content Type”</a>.</p>

              <p>Be aware that because the width of a keyword field is
        measured in bytes, the potential for corruption of
        multibyte values exists.  For example, a username that
        contains some multibyte UTF-8 characters might suffer
        truncation in the middle of the string of bytes that make
        up one of those characters.  The result will be a mere
        truncation when viewed at the byte level, but will likely
        appear as a string with an incorrect or garbled final
        character when viewed as UTF-8 text.  It is conceivable
        that certain applications, when asked to load the file,
        would notice the broken UTF-8 text and deem the entire
        file corrupt, refusing to operate on the file
        altogether.  So, when limiting keywords to a fixed size,
        choose a size that allows for this type of byte-wise
        expansion.</p>
