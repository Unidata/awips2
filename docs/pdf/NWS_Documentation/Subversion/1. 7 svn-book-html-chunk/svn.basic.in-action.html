      <p>We've mentioned already that Subversion is a modern,
      network-aware version control system.  As we described in
      <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.version-control-basics.html" title="Version Control Basics">the section called “Version Control Basics”</a> (our
      high-level version control overview), a repository serves as the
      core storage mechanism for Subversion's versioned data, and it's
      via working copies that users and their software programs
      interact with that data.  In this section, we'll begin to
      introduce the specific ways in which Subversion implements
      version control.</p>
      <div class="sect2" title="Subversion Repositories">
        <div class="titlepage">

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Subversion implements the concept of a version control
        repository much as any other modern version control system
        would.  Unlike a working copy, a Subversion repository is an
        abstract entity, able to be operated upon almost exclusively
        by Subversion's own libraries and tools.  As most of a user's
        Subversion interactions involve the use of the Subversion
        client and occur in the context of a working copy, we spend
        the majority of this book discussing the Subversion working
        copy and how to manipulate it.  For the finer details of the
        repository, though, check out
        <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.html" title="Chapter 5. Repository Administration">Chapter 5, <i>Repository Administration</i></a>.</p>

        <a id="idp32239216" class="indexterm"></a>
        <p>A Subversion client commits (that is, communicates the
        changes made to) any number of files and directories as a
        single atomic transaction.  By atomic transaction, we mean
        simply this: either all of the changes are accepted into the
        repository, or none of them is.  Subversion tries to retain
        this atomicity in the face of program crashes, system crashes,
        network problems, and other users' actions.</p>
        <p>Each time the repository accepts a commit, this creates a
        new state of the filesystem tree, called a
        <em class="firstterm">revision</em>.  Each revision is assigned a
        unique natural number, one greater than the number assigned to
        the previous revision.  The initial revision of a freshly
        created repository is numbered 0 and consists of nothing but
        an empty root directory.</p>
        <p><a class="xref" href="svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.basic.in-action.revs.dia-1" title="Figure 1.6. Tree changes over time">Figure 1.6, “Tree changes over time”</a>
        illustrates a nice way to visualize the repository.  Imagine
        an array of revision numbers, starting at 0, stretching from
        left to right.  Each revision number has a filesystem tree
        hanging below it, and each tree is a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">snapshot</span>”</span>
        of the way the repository looked after a commit.</p>

          <p>Unlike most version control systems, Subversion's
          revision numbers apply to <span class="emphasis"><em>entire trees</em></span>,
          not individual files.  Each revision number selects an
          entire tree, a particular state of the repository after some
          committed change.  Another way to think about it is that
          revision N represents the state of the repository filesystem
          after the Nth commit.  When Subversion users talk
          about <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">revision 5 of
          <code class="filename">foo.c</code>,</span>”</span> they really mean
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote"><code class="filename">foo.c</code> as it appears in revision
          5.</span>”</span> Notice that in general, revisions N and M of a
          file do <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> necessarily differ!  Many
          other version control systems use per-file revision numbers,
          so this concept may seem unusual at first. (Former CVS users
          might want to see <a class="xref" href="svn.forcvs.html" title="Appendix B. Subversion for CVS Users">Appendix B, <i>Subversion for CVS Users</i></a> for more

        <p>Subversion client programs use URLs to identify versioned
        files and directories in Subversion repositories.  For the
        most part, these URLs use the standard syntax, allowing for
        server names and port numbers to be specified as part of the
        URL.</p>

        <p>Subversion repository URLs aren't limited to only
        the <code class="literal">http://</code> variety.  Because Subversion
        offers several different ways for its clients to communicate
        with its servers, the URLs used to address the repository
        change subtly depending on which repository access mechanism
        is employed.  <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.basic.in-action.wc.tbl-1" title="Table 1.1. Repository access URLs">Table 1.1, “Repository access URLs”</a>

        repository access methods.  For more details about
        Subversion's server options, see

        <br class="table-break" />
        <p>Subversion's handling of URLs has some notable nuances.
        For example, URLs containing the <code class="literal">file://</code>
        access method (used for local repositories) must, in
        accordance with convention, have either a server name
        of <code class="literal">localhost</code> or no server name at
        all:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc" compact="compact">
              <li class="listitem">file:///var/svn/repos</li>
              <li class="listitem">file://localhost/var/svn/repos</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Also, users of the <code class="literal">file://</code> scheme on
        Windows platforms will need to use an unofficially
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">standard</span>”</span> syntax for accessing repositories
        that are on the same machine, but on a different drive than
        the client's current working drive.  Either of the two
        following URL path syntaxes will work, where
        <code class="literal">X</code> is the drive on which the repository
        resides:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc" compact="compact">
              <li class="listitem">file:///X:/var/svn/repos</li>
              <li class="listitem">file:///X|/var/svn/repos</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Note that a URL uses forward slashes even though the
        native (non-URL) form of a path on Windows uses backslashes.
        Also note that when using
        the <code class="literal">file:///<em class="replaceable"><code>X</code></em>|/</code>
        form at the command line, you need to quote the URL (wrap it
        in quotation marks) so that the vertical bar character is not
        interpreted as a pipe.</p>
        <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">

                <p>You cannot use Subversion's <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs
          in a regular web browser the way typical
          <code class="literal">file://</code> URLs can.  When you attempt to view
          a <code class="literal">file://</code> URL in a regular web browser, it
          reads and displays the contents of the file at that location
          by examining the filesystem directly.  However, Subversion's
          resources exist in a virtual filesystem (see <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.layerlib.html#svn.developer.layerlib.repos" title="Repository Layer">the section called “Repository Layer”</a>), and your browser
          will not understand how to interact with that
          filesystem.</p>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>The Subversion client will automatically encode URLs as
        necessary, just like a web browser does.  For example, the URL
        <code class="literal">http://host/path with space/project/españa</code>
        — which contains both spaces and upper-ASCII characters
        — will be automatically interpreted by Subversion as if
        you'd provided
        <code class="literal">http://host/path%20with%20space/project/espa%C3%B1a</code>.
        If the URL contains spaces, be sure to place it within
        quotation marks at the command line so that your shell treats
        the whole thing as a single argument to the program.</p>
        <p>There is one notable exception to Subversion's handling of
        URLs which also applies to its handling of local paths in many
        contexts, too.  If the final path component of your URL or
        local path contains an at sign (<code class="literal">@</code>), you need
        to use a special syntax—described in
        <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.pegrevs.html" title="Peg and Operative Revisions">the section called “Peg and Operative Revisions”</a>—in order to make
        Subversion properly address that resource.</p>
        <p>In Subversion 1.6, a new caret (<code class="literal">^</code>)
        notation was introduced as a shorthand for <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the URL of
        the repository's root directory</span>”</span>.  For example, you can
        use the <code class="literal">^/tags/bigsandwich/</code> to refer to the
        URL of the <code class="filename">/tags/bigsandwich</code> directory in
        the root of the repository.  Note that this URL syntax works
        only when your current working directory is a working
        copy—the command-line client knows the repository's root
        URL by looking at the working copy's metadata.  Also note that
        when you wish to refer precisely to the root directory of the
        repository, you must do so using <code class="literal">^/</code> (with
        the trailing slash character), not merely
        <code class="literal">^</code>.</p>

        <p>A Subversion working copy is an ordinary directory tree on
        your local system, containing a collection of files.  You can
        edit these files however you wish, and if they're source code
        files, you can compile your program from them in the usual
        way.  Your working copy is your own private work area:
        Subversion will never incorporate other people's changes, nor
        make your own changes available to others, until you
        explicitly tell it to do so.  You can even have multiple
        working copies of the same project.</p>
        <p>After you've made some changes to the files in your
        working copy and verified that they work properly, Subversion
        provides you with commands to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">publish</span>”</span> your
        changes to the other people working with you on your project
        (by writing to the repository).  If other people publish their
        own changes, Subversion provides you with commands to merge
        those changes into your working copy (by reading from the
        repository).</p>
        <p>A working copy also contains some extra files, created and
        maintained by Subversion, to help it carry out these commands.
        In particular, each directory in your working copy contains a
        subdirectory named <code class="filename">.svn</code>, also known as
        the working copy's <em class="firstterm">administrative
        directory</em>.  The files in each administrative
        directory help Subversion recognize which files contain
        unpublished changes, and which files are out of date with
        respect to others' work.</p>

              <li class="listitem">

          <p>Given this information, by talking to the repository,

                <p>The file is unchanged in the working directory, and
                no changes to that file have been committed to the
                repository since its working revision.  An <span class="command"><strong>svn

                <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> of the file will do
                nothing.</p>
              </dd>

                changes that have not been committed to the repository;
                thus an <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> of the file will
                succeed in publishing your changes, and an <span class="command"><strong>svn

                The file should eventually be updated in order to make
                it current with the latest public revision.
                An <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> of the file will do

                <p>The file has been changed both in the working

                updated first; an <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> command
                will attempt to merge the public changes with the local
                changes.  If Subversion can't complete the merge in a
                plausible way automatically, it leaves it to the user to
                resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>A typical Subversion repository often holds the files (or
          source code) for several projects; usually, each project is a
          subdirectory in the repository's filesystem tree.  In this
          arrangement, a user's working copy will usually correspond to
          a particular subtree of the repository.</p>
          <p>For example, suppose you have a repository that contains
          two software projects, <code class="literal">paint</code> and
          <code class="literal">calc</code>.  Each project lives in its own
          top-level subdirectory, as shown in <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.basic.in-action.wc.dia-1" title="Figure 1.7. The repository's filesystem">Figure 1.7, “The repository's filesystem”</a>.</p>
          <div class="figure">

            <p class="title">

          <a id="idp32334224" class="indexterm"></a>
          <p>To get a working copy, you must <em class="firstterm">check
          out</em> some subtree of the repository.  (The term
          <span class="emphasis"><em>check out</em></span> may sound like it has something to do
          with locking or reserving resources, but it doesn't; it simply
          creates a working copy of the project for you.)  For example,
          if you check out <code class="filename">/calc</code>, you will get a
          working copy like this:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc
A    calc/Makefile
A    calc/integer.c
A    calc/button.c
Checked out revision 56.
$ ls -A calc
Makefile  button.c integer.c .svn/
$
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>The list of letter <code class="literal">A</code>s in the left
          margin indicates that Subversion is adding a number of items
          to your working copy.  You now have a personal copy of the
          repository's <code class="filename">/calc</code> directory, with one
          additional entry—<code class="filename">.svn</code>—which
          holds the extra information needed by Subversion, as mentioned
          earlier.</p>
          <p>Suppose you make changes to <code class="filename">button.c</code>.
          Since the <code class="filename">.svn</code> directory remembers the
          file's original modification date and contents, Subversion can
          tell that you've changed the file.  However, Subversion does
          not make your changes public until you explicitly tell it to.
          The act of publishing your changes is more commonly known as
          <em class="firstterm">committing</em> (or <em class="firstterm">checking
          in</em>) changes to the repository.</p>
          <a id="idp32344112" class="indexterm"></a>
          <a id="idp32345888" class="indexterm"></a>
          <a id="idp32347280" class="indexterm"></a>
          <p>To publish your changes to others, you can use
          Subversion's <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svn commit button.c -m "Fixed a typo in button.c."
Sending        button.c
Transmitting file data .

$
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Now your changes to <code class="filename">button.c</code> have
          been committed to the repository, with a note describing your
          change (namely, that you fixed a typo).  If another user
          checks out a working copy of <code class="filename">/calc</code>, she
          will see your changes in the latest version of the
          file.</p>
          <p>Suppose you have a collaborator, Sally, who checked out a
          working copy of <code class="filename">/calc</code> at the same time
          you did.  When you commit your change to
          <code class="filename">button.c</code>, Sally's working copy is left
          unchanged; Subversion modifies working copies only at the
          user's request.</p>
          <a id="idp32354816" class="indexterm"></a>
          <a id="idp32356592" class="indexterm"></a>
          <a id="idp32357984" class="indexterm"></a>
          <p>To bring her project up to date, Sally can ask Subversion
          to <em class="firstterm">update</em> her working copy, by using
          the <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> command.  This will incorporate
          your changes into her working copy, as well as any others that
          have been committed since she checked it out.</p>
          <div class="informalexample">

          <code class="filename">button.c</code>.  Note that Sally didn't need to
          specify which files to update; Subversion uses the information
          in the <code class="filename">.svn</code> directory as well as further
          information in the repository, to decide which files need to
          be brought up to date.</p>

          </div>
          <a id="idp32366160" class="indexterm"></a>
          <p>As a general principle, Subversion tries to be as flexible
          as possible.  One special kind of flexibility is the ability
          to have a working copy containing files and directories with a
          mix of different working revision numbers.  Subversion working
          copies do not always correspond to any single revision in the
          repository; they may contain files from several different
          revisions.  For example, suppose you check out a working copy
          from a repository whose most recent revision is 4:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <div class="literallayout">
              <p><br />
calc/<br />
   Makefile:4<br />
   integer.c:4<br />
   button.c:4<br />
</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>At the moment, this working directory corresponds exactly
          to revision 4 in the repository.  However, suppose you make a
          change to <code class="filename">button.c</code>, and commit that
          change.  Assuming no other commits have taken place, your
          commit will create revision 5 of the repository, and your
          working copy will now look like this:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <div class="literallayout">
              <p><br />
calc/<br />
   Makefile:4<br />
   integer.c:4<br />
   button.c:5<br />
</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Suppose that, at this point, Sally commits a change to
          <code class="filename">integer.c</code>, creating revision 6.  If you
          use <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to bring your working copy
          up to date, it will look like this:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <div class="literallayout">
              <p><br />
calc/<br />
   Makefile:6<br />
   integer.c:6<br />
   button.c:6<br />
</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Sally's change to <code class="filename">integer.c</code> will
          appear in your working copy, and your change will still be
          present in <code class="filename">button.c</code>.  In this example,
          the text of <code class="filename">Makefile</code> is identical in
          revisions 4, 5, and 6, but Subversion will mark your working
          copy of <code class="filename">Makefile</code> with revision 6 to
          indicate that it is still current.  So, after you do a clean
          update at the top of your working copy, it will generally
          correspond to exactly one revision in the repository.</p>
          <div class="sect4" title="Updates and commits are separate">
            <div class="titlepage">
              <div>
                <div>
                  <h5 class="title"><a id="svn.basic.in-action.mixedrevs.update-commit"></a>Updates and commits are separate</h5>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>One of the fundamental rules of Subversion is that
            a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">push</span>”</span> action does not cause
            a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pull,</span>”</span> nor vice versa.  Just
            because you're ready to submit new changes to the repository
            doesn't mean you're ready to receive changes from other
            people.  And if you have new changes still in progress,
            <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> should gracefully merge
            repository changes into your own, rather than forcing you to
            publish them.</p>
            <p>The main side effect of this rule is that it means a
            working copy has to do extra bookkeeping to track mixed
            revisions as well as be tolerant of the mixture.  It's made
            more complicated by the fact that directories themselves are
            versioned.</p>
            <p>For example, suppose you have a working copy entirely at
            revision 10.  You edit the
            file <code class="filename">foo.html</code> and then perform
            an <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>, which creates revision 15
            in the repository.  After the commit succeeds, many new
            users would expect the working copy to be entirely at
            revision 15, but that's not the case!  Any number of changes
            might have happened in the repository between revisions 10
            and 15.  The client knows nothing of those changes in the
            repository, since you haven't yet run <span class="command"><strong>svn
            update</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> doesn't
            pull down new changes.  If, on the other hand,
            <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> were to automatically download
            the newest changes, it would be possible to set the
            entire working copy to revision 15—but then we'd be
            breaking the fundamental rule of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">push</span>”</span>
            and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pull</span>”</span> remaining separate actions.
            Therefore, the only safe thing the Subversion client can do
            is mark the one
            file—<code class="filename">foo.html</code>—as being at
            revision 15.  The rest of the working copy remains at
            revision 10.  Only by running <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>
            can the latest changes be downloaded and the whole working
            copy be marked as revision 15.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
            <p>The fact is, <span class="emphasis"><em>every time</em></span> you run
            <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> your working copy ends up
            with some mixture of revisions.  The things you just
            committed are marked as having larger working revisions than
            everything else.  After several commits (with no updates
            in between), your working copy will contain a whole mixture
            of revisions.  Even if you're the only person using the
            repository, you will still see this phenomenon.  To examine
            your mixture of working revisions, use the <span class="command"><strong>svn
            status</strong></span> command with the <code class="option">--verbose</code>
            (<code class="option">-v</code>) option (see
            <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.examine.status" title="See an overview of your changes">the section called “See an overview of your changes”</a> for more
            information).</p>
            <p>Often, new users are completely unaware that their
            working copy contains mixed revisions.  This can be
            confusing, because many client commands are sensitive to the
            working revision of the item they're examining.  For
            example, the <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> command is used to
            display the history of changes to a file or directory (see
            <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.history.html#svn.tour.history.log" title="Generating a List of Historical Changes">the section called “Generating a List of Historical Changes”</a>).  When the user
            invokes this command on a working copy object, he expects
            to see the entire history of the object.  But if the
            object's working revision is quite old (often because
            <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> hasn't been run in a long
            time), the history of the <span class="emphasis"><em>older</em></span>
            version of the object is shown.</p>

            <p>If your project is sufficiently complex, you'll discover
            that it's sometimes nice to
            forcibly <em class="firstterm">backdate</em> (or update to a
            revision older than the one you already have) portions of
            your working copy to an earlier revision; you'll learn how
            to do that in <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.html" title="Chapter 2. Basic Usage">Chapter 2, <i>Basic Usage</i></a>.  Perhaps you'd
            like to test an earlier version of a submodule contained in
            a subdirectory, or perhaps you'd like to figure out when a
            bug first came into existence in a specific file.  This is
            the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">time machine</span>”</span> aspect of a version control
            system—the feature that allows you to move any
            portion of your working copy forward and backward in
            history.</p>

            <p>However you make use of mixed revisions in your working
            copy, there are limitations to this flexibility.</p>
            <p>First, you cannot commit the deletion of a file or
            directory that isn't fully up to date.  If a newer version
            of the item exists in the repository, your attempt to delete
            will be rejected to prevent you from accidentally
            destroying changes you've not yet seen.</p>
            <p>Second, you cannot commit a metadata change to a
            directory unless it's fully up to date.  You'll learn about
            attaching <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">properties</span>”</span> to items in <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.html" title="Chapter 3. Advanced Topics">Chapter 3, <i>Advanced Topics</i></a>.  A directory's working revision
            defines a specific set of entries and properties, and thus
            committing a property change to an out-of-date directory may
            destroy properties you've not yet seen.</p>
