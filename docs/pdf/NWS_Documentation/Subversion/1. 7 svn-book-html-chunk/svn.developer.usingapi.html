      </div>
      <p>Developing applications against the Subversion library APIs
      is fairly straightforward.  Subversion is primarily a set of C
      libraries, with header (<code class="filename">.h</code>) files that live
      in the <code class="filename">subversion/include</code> directory of the
      source tree.  These headers are copied into your system
      locations (e.g., <code class="filename">/usr/local/include</code>)
      when you build and install Subversion itself from source.  These
      headers represent the entirety of the functions and types meant
      to be accessible by users of the Subversion libraries.  The
      Subversion developer community is meticulous about ensuring that
      the public API is well documented—refer directly to the
      header files for that documentation.</p>
      <p>When examining the public header files, the first thing you
      might notice is that Subversion's datatypes and functions are
      namespace-protected.  That is, every public Subversion symbol
      name begins with <code class="literal">svn_</code>, followed by a short
      code for the library in which the symbol is defined (such as
      <code class="literal">wc</code>, <code class="literal">client</code>,
      <code class="literal">fs</code>, etc.), followed by a single underscore
      (<code class="literal">_</code>), and then the rest of the symbol name.
      Semipublic functions (used among source files of a given
      library but not by code outside that library, and found inside
      the library directories themselves) differ from this naming
      scheme in that instead of a single underscore after the library
      code, they use a double underscore
      (<code class="literal">_ _</code>).  Functions that are private to
      a given source file have no special prefixing and are declared
      <code class="literal">static</code>.  Of course, a compiler isn't
      interested in these naming conventions, but they help to clarify
      the scope of a given function or datatype.</p>
      <p>Another good source of information about programming against
      the Subversion APIs is the project's own hacking guidelines,
      which you can find at
      <a class="ulink" href="http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/" target="_top">http://subversion.apache.org/docs/community-guide/</a>.  This document contains useful information, which, while
      aimed at developers and would-be developers of Subversion
      itself, is equally applicable to folks developing against
      Subversion as a set of third-party
      libraries.<sup>[<a id="idp41945664" href="#ftn.idp41945664" class="footnote">56</a>]</sup></p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Along with Subversion's own datatypes, you will see many
        references to datatypes that begin with
        <code class="literal">apr_</code>—symbols from the Apache Portable
        Runtime (APR) library.  APR is Apache's portability library,
        originally carved out of its server code as an attempt to
        separate the OS-specific bits from the OS-independent portions
        of the code.  The result was a library that provides a generic
        API for performing operations that differ mildly—or
        wildly—from OS to OS.  While the Apache HTTP Server was
        obviously the first user of the APR library, the Subversion
        developers immediately recognized the value of using APR as
        well.  This means that there is practically no OS-specific
        code in Subversion itself.  Also, it means that the Subversion
        client compiles and runs anywhere that the Apache HTTP Server
        does.  Currently, this list includes all flavors of Unix,
        Win32, BeOS, OS/2, and Mac OS X.</p>
        <p>In addition to providing consistent implementations of
        system calls that differ across operating
        systems,<sup>[<a id="idp41949264" href="#ftn.idp41949264" class="footnote">57</a>]</sup> APR gives
        Subversion immediate access to many custom datatypes, such as
        dynamic arrays and hash tables.  Subversion uses these types
        extensively.  But perhaps the most pervasive APR datatype,
        found in nearly every Subversion API prototype, is the
        <code class="literal">apr_pool_t</code>—the APR memory pool.
        Subversion uses pools internally for all its memory allocation
        needs (unless an external library requires a different memory
        management mechanism for data passed through its
        API),<sup>[<a id="idp41952496" href="#ftn.idp41952496" class="footnote">58</a>]</sup> and while a person coding against
        the Subversion APIs is not required to do the same,
        she <span class="emphasis"><em>is</em></span> required to provide pools to the
        API functions that need them.  This means that users of the
        Subversion API must also link against APR, must
        call <code class="function">apr_initialize()</code> to initialize the
        APR subsystem, and then must create and manage pools for use
        with Subversion API calls, typically by
        using <code class="function">svn_pool_create()</code>,
        <code class="function">svn_pool_clear()</code>, and
        <code class="function">svn_pool_destroy()</code>.</p>
        <div class="sidebar" title="Programming with Memory Pools">
          <p class="title">
            <b>Programming with Memory Pools</b>
          </p>
          <p>Almost every developer who has used the C programming
          language has at some point sighed at the daunting task of
          managing memory usage.  Allocating enough memory to use,
          keeping track of those allocations, freeing the memory when
          you no longer need it—these tasks can be quite
          complex.  And of course, failure to do those things properly
          can result in a program that crashes itself, or worse,
          crashes the computer.</p>
          <p>Higher-level languages, on the other hand, either take
          the job of memory management away from you completely or
          make it something you toy with only when doing extremely
          tight program optimization.  Languages such as Java and
          Python use <em class="firstterm">garbage collection</em>,
          allocating memory for objects when needed, and automatically
          freeing that memory when the object is no longer in
          use.</p>
          <p>APR provides a middle-ground approach called
          <em class="firstterm">pool-based memory management</em>.  It
          allows the developer to control memory usage at a lower
          resolution—per chunk (or <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pool</span>”</span>) of
          memory, instead of per allocated object.  Rather than using
          <code class="function">malloc()</code> and friends to allocate enough
          memory for a given object, you ask APR to allocate the
          memory from a memory pool.  When you're finished using the
          objects you've created in the pool, you destroy the entire
          pool, effectively de-allocating the memory consumed by
          <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the objects you allocated from it.
          Thus, rather than keeping track of individual objects that
          need to be de-allocated, your program simply considers the
          general lifetimes of those objects and allocates the objects
          in a pool whose lifetime (the time between the pool's
          creation and its deletion) matches the object's
          needs.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>With remote version control operation as the whole point
        of Subversion's existence, it makes sense that some attention
        has been paid to internationalization (i18n) support.  After
        all, while <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">remote</span>”</span> might mean <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">across the
        office,</span>”</span> it could just as well mean <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">across the
        globe.</span>”</span> To facilitate this, all of Subversion's public
        interfaces that accept path arguments expect those paths to be
        canonicalized—which is most easily accomplished by passing
        them through the <code class="function">svn_path_canonicalize()</code>
        function—and encoded in UTF-8.  This means, for example, that
        any new client binary that drives the
        <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code> interface needs to first
        convert paths from the locale-specific encoding to UTF-8
        before passing those paths to the Subversion libraries, and
        then reconvert any resultant output paths from Subversion
        back into the locale's encoding before using those paths for
        non-Subversion purposes.  Fortunately, Subversion provides a
        suite of functions (see
        <code class="filename">subversion/include/svn_utf.h</code>) that 
        any program can use to do these conversions.</p>
        <p>Also, Subversion APIs require all URL parameters to be
        properly URI-encoded.  So, instead of passing
        <code class="uri">file:///home/username/My File.txt</code> as the URL of a
        file named <code class="filename">My File.txt</code>, you need to pass
        <code class="uri">file:///home/username/My%20File.txt</code>.  Again,
        Subversion supplies helper functions that your application can
        use—<code class="function">svn_path_uri_encode()</code> and
        <code class="function">svn_path_uri_decode()</code>, for URI encoding
        and decoding, respectively.</p>

        <p>If you are interested in using the Subversion libraries in
        conjunction with something other than a C program—say, a
        Python or Perl script—Subversion has some support for this
        via the Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG).  The
        SWIG bindings for Subversion are located in
        <code class="filename">subversion/bindings/swig</code>.  They are still
        maturing, but they are usable.  These bindings allow you
        to call Subversion API functions indirectly, using wrappers that
        translate the datatypes native to your scripting language into
        the datatypes needed by Subversion's C libraries.</p>
        <p>Significant efforts have been made toward creating
        functional SWIG-generated bindings for Python, Perl, and Ruby.
        To some extent, the work done preparing the SWIG interface
        files for these languages is reusable in efforts to generate
        bindings for other languages supported by SWIG (which include
        versions of C#, Guile, Java, MzScheme, OCaml, PHP, and Tcl,
        among others).  However, some extra programming is required to
        compensate for complex APIs that SWIG needs some help
        translating between languages.  For more information on SWIG
        itself, see the project's web site at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.swig.org/" target="_top">http://www.swig.org/</a>.</p>
        <p>Subversion also has language bindings for Java.  The
        javahl bindings (located in
        <code class="filename">subversion/bindings/java</code> in the
        Subversion source tree) aren't SWIG-based, but are instead a
        mixture of Java and hand-coded JNI.  Javahl covers most
        Subversion client-side APIs and is specifically targeted at
        implementors of Java-based Subversion clients and IDE
        integrations.</p>
        <p>Subversion's language bindings tend to lack the level of
        developer attention given to the core Subversion modules, but
        can generally be trusted as production-ready.  A number of
        scripts and applications, alternative Subversion GUI clients,
        and other third-party tools are successfully using
        Subversion's language bindings today to accomplish their
        Subversion integrations.</p>
        <p>It's worth noting here that there are other options for
        interfacing with Subversion using other languages:  alternative
        bindings for Subversion that aren't provided by the
        Subversion development community at all.  There
        are a couple of popular ones we feel are especially
        noteworthy.  First, Barry Scott's PySVN bindings (<a class="ulink" href="http://pysvn.tigris.org/" target="_top">http://pysvn.tigris.org/</a>) are a popular option for
        binding with Python.  PySVN boasts of a more Pythonic
        interface than the more C-like APIs provided by Subversion's
        own Python bindings.  And if you're looking for a pure Java
        implementation of Subversion, check out SVNKit (<a class="ulink" href="http://svnkit.com/" target="_top">http://svnkit.com/</a>), which is Subversion rewritten
        from the ground up in Java.</p>
        <div class="sidebar" title="SVNKit Versus javahl">
          <p class="title">
            <b>SVNKit Versus javahl</b>
          </p>
          <p>In 2005, a small company called TMate announced the
          1.0.0 release of JavaSVN—a pure Java implementation of
          Subversion.  Since then, the project has been renamed to
          SVNKit (available at <a class="ulink" href="http://svnkit.com/" target="_top">http://svnkit.com/</a>)
          and has seen great success as a provider of Subversion
          functionality to various Subversion clients, IDE
          integrations, and other third-party tools.</p>
          <p>The SVNKit library is interesting in that, unlike the
          javahl library, it is not merely a wrapper around the
          official Subversion core libraries.  In fact, it shares no
          code with Subversion at all.  But while it is easy to
          confuse SVNKit with javahl, and easier still to not even
          realize which of these libraries you are using, folks should
          be aware that SVNKit differs from javahl in some significant
          ways.  First, while SVNKit is developed as open source
          software just like Subversion, SVNKit's license is more
          restrictive than that of
          Subversion.<sup>[<a id="idp41985744" href="#ftn.idp41985744" class="footnote">59</a>]</sup>  Finally, by aiming to be a
          pure Java Subversion library, SVNKit is limited in which
          portions of Subversion can be reasonably cloned while still
          keeping up with Subversion's releases.  This has already
          happened once—SVNKit cannot access BDB-backed
          Subversion repositories via the <code class="literal">file://</code>
          protocol because there's no pure Java implementation of
          Berkeley DB that is file-format-compatible with the native
          implementation of that library.</p>
          <p>That said, SVNKit has a well-established track record of
          reliability.  And a pure Java solution is much more robust
          in the face of programming errors—a bug in SVNKit
          might raise a catchable Java Exception, but a bug in the
          Subversion core libraries as accessed via javahl can bring
          down your entire Java Runtime Environment.  So, weigh the
          costs when choosing a Java-based Subversion
          implementation.</p>

        of the concepts we've been discussing.  It uses both the

        the prefixes <code class="literal">svn_repos_</code> and
        <code class="literal">svn_fs_</code> of the function names,
        respectively) to create a new revision in which a directory is
        added.  You can see the use of an APR pool, which is passed
        around for memory allocation purposes.  Also, the code reveals
        a somewhat obscure fact about Subversion error
        handling—all Subversion errors must be explicitly
        handled to avoid memory leakage (and in some cases,

        automatically perform some set of non-Subversion tasks every
        time you commit a transaction (e.g., sending an
        email that describes all the changes made in that transaction
        to your developer mailing list), you need to use the
        <code class="filename">libsvn_repos</code>-wrapped version of that
        function, which adds the hook triggering
        functionality—in this case,
        <code class="function">svn_repos_fs_commit_txn()</code>.  (For more

        <p>This same program in C would need to deal with APR's
        memory pool system.  But Python handles memory usage
        automatically, and Subversion's Python bindings adhere to that
        convention.  In C, you'd be working with custom datatypes
        (such as those provided by the APR library) for representing
        the hash of entries and the list of paths, but Python has
        hashes (called <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">dictionaries</span>”</span>) and lists as
        built-in datatypes, and it provides a rich collection of
        functions for operating on those types.  So SWIG (with the
        help of some customizations in Subversion's language bindings
        layer) takes care of mapping those custom datatypes into the
        native datatypes of the target language.  This provides a more
        intuitive interface for users of that language.</p>
        <p>The Subversion Python bindings can be used for working
        copy operations, too.  In the previous section of this
        chapter, we mentioned the <code class="filename">libsvn_client</code>
        interface and how it exists for the sole purpose of
        simplifying the process of writing a Subversion client.  <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.usingapi.html#svn.developer.usingapi.otherlangs.ex-2" title="Example 8.3. A Python status crawler">Example 8.3, “A Python status crawler”</a> is a brief
