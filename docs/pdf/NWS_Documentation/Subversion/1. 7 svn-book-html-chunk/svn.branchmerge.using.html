      <p>At this point, you should understand how each commit creates
      a new state of the filesystem tree (called a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">revision</span>”</span>)
      in the repository.  If you don't, go back and read about revisions in
      <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.in-action.html#svn.basic.in-action.revs" title="Revisions">the section called “Revisions”</a>.</p>
      <p>For this chapter, we'll go back to the same example from
      <a class="xref" href="svn.basic.html" title="Chapter 1. Fundamental Concepts">Chapter 1, <i>Fundamental Concepts</i></a>.  Remember that you and your
      collaborator, Sally, are sharing a repository that contains two
      projects, <code class="filename">paint</code> and
      <code class="filename">calc</code>.  Notice that in <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.using.html#svn.branchmerge.using.dia-1" title="Figure 4.2. Starting repository layout">Figure 4.2, “Starting repository layout”</a>, however, each project
      directory now contains subdirectories named
      <code class="filename">trunk</code> and <code class="filename">branches</code>.
      The reason for this will soon become clear.</p>
      <div class="figure">
        <a id="svn.branchmerge.using.dia-1"></a>
        <p class="title">
          <b>Figure 4.2. Starting repository layout</b>
        </p>
        <div class="figure-contents">
          <div>
            <img src="images/ch04dia2.png" alt="Starting repository layout" />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br class="figure-break" />
      <p>As before, assume that Sally and you both have working
      copies of the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">calc</span>”</span> project.  Specifically, you
      each have a working copy of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.
      All the files for the project are in this subdirectory rather
      than in <code class="filename">/calc</code> itself, because your team has
      decided that <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> is where the
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">main line</span>”</span> of development is going to take
      place.</p>
      <p>Let's say that you've been given the task of implementing a
      large software feature.  It will take a long time to write, and
      will affect all the files in the project.  The immediate problem
      is that you don't want to interfere with Sally, who is in the
      process of fixing small bugs here and there.  She's depending on
      the fact that the latest version of the project (in
      <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>) is always usable.  If you
      start committing your changes bit by bit, you'll surely break
      things for Sally (and other team members as well).</p>
      <p>One strategy is to crawl into a hole: you and Sally can stop
      sharing information for a week or two.  That is, start gutting
      and reorganizing all the files in your working copy, but don't
      commit or update until you're completely finished with the task.
      There are a number of problems with this, though.  First, it's
      not very safe.  Most people like to save their work to the
      repository frequently, should something bad accidentally happen
      to their working copy.  Second, it's not very flexible.  If you
      do your work on different computers (perhaps you have a working
      copy of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> on two different
      machines), you'll need to manually copy your changes back and
      forth or just do all the work on a single computer.  By that
      same token, it's difficult to share your changes in progress
      with anyone else.  A common software development <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">best
      practice</span>”</span> is to allow your peers to review your work as
      you go.  If nobody sees your intermediate commits, you lose
      potential feedback and may end up going down the wrong path for
      weeks before another person on your team notices.  Finally, when
      you're finished with all your changes, you might find it very
      difficult to remerge your final work with the rest of the
      company's main body of code.  Sally (or others) may have made
      many other changes in the repository that are difficult to
      incorporate into your working copy—especially if you
      run <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> after weeks of
      isolation.</p>
      <p>The better solution is to create your own branch, or line of
      development, in the repository.  This allows you to save your
      half-broken work frequently without interfering with others, yet
      you can still selectively share information with your
      collaborators.  You'll see exactly how this works as we go.

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Creating a branch is very simple—you make a copy of
        the project in the repository using the <span class="command"><strong>svn
        copy</strong></span> command.  Subversion is able to copy not only 
        single files, but whole directories as well.  In this case,
        you want to make a copy of the
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> directory.  Where should the
        new copy live?  Wherever you wish—it's a matter of
        project policy.  Let's say that your team has a policy of
        creating branches in the <code class="filename">/calc/branches</code>
        area of the repository, and you want to name your branch
        <code class="literal">my-calc-branch</code>.  You'll want to create a
        new directory,
        <code class="filename">/calc/branches/my-calc-branch</code>, which
        begins its life as a copy of
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.</p>
        <p>You may already have seen <span class="command"><strong>svn copy</strong></span> used
        to copy one file to another within a working copy.  But it can
        also be used to do a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">remote</span>”</span> copy entirely
        within the repository.  Just copy one URL to another:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \
      -m "Creating a private branch of /calc/trunk."

Committed revision 341.
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>This command causes a near-instantaneous commit in the
        repository, creating a new directory in revision 341.  The new
        directory is a copy of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.  This
        is shown in <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.using.html#svn.branchmerge.using.create.dia-1" title="Figure 4.3. Repository with new copy">Figure 4.3, “Repository with new copy”</a>.<sup>[<a id="idp35935552" href="#ftn.idp35935552" class="footnote">23</a>]</sup>  While
        it's also possible to create a branch by using <span class="command"><strong>svn
        copy</strong></span> to duplicate a directory within the working
        copy, this technique isn't recommended.  It can be quite slow,
        in fact!  Copying a directory on the client side is a
        linear-time operation, in that it actually has to duplicate
        every file and subdirectory within that working copy directory
        on the local disk.  Copying a directory on the server,
        however, is a constant-time operation, and it's the way most
        people create branches.</p>

          </p>
          <p>Subversion's repository has a special design.  When you
          copy a directory, you don't need to worry about the
          repository growing huge—Subversion doesn't actually
          duplicate any data.  Instead, it creates a new directory
          entry that points to an <span class="emphasis"><em>existing</em></span> tree.
          If you're an experienced Unix user, you'll recognize this as
          the same concept behind a hard link.  As further changes are
          made to files and directories beneath the copied directory,
          Subversion continues to employ this hard link concept where
          it can.  It duplicates data only when it is necessary to
          disambiguate different versions of objects.</p>
          <p>This is why you'll often hear Subversion users talk
          about <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cheap copies.</span>”</span>  It doesn't matter how
          large the directory is—it takes a very tiny, constant
          amount of time and space to make a copy of it.  In fact,
          this feature is the basis of how commits work in Subversion:
          each revision is a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">cheap copy</span>”</span> of the previous
          revision, with a few items lazily changed within.  (To read
          more about this, visit Subversion's web site and read about
          the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">bubble up</span>”</span> method in Subversion's design
          documents.)</p>
          <p>Of course, these internal mechanics of copying and
          sharing data are hidden from the user, who simply sees
          copies of trees.  The main point here is that copies are
          cheap, both in time and in space.  If you create a branch
          entirely within the repository (by running <strong class="userinput"><code>svn copy
          <em class="replaceable"><code>URL1</code></em> <em class="replaceable"><code>URL2</code></em></code></strong>),
          it's a quick, constant-time operation.  Make branches as
          often as you want.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Now that you've created a branch of the project, you can
        check out a new working copy to start using it:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn checkout http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch
A  my-calc-branch/Makefile
A  my-calc-branch/integer.c
A  my-calc-branch/button.c
Checked out revision 341.
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>There's nothing special about this working copy; it simply
        mirrors a different directory in the repository.  When you
        commit changes, however, Sally won't see them when she
        updates, because her working copy is of
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>.  (Be sure to read <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.switchwc.html" title="Traversing Branches">the section called “Traversing Branches”</a> later in this chapter: the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> command is an alternative way of
        creating a working copy of a branch.)</p>
        <p>Let's pretend that a week goes by, and the following
        commits happen:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">

        these two commits affected different files in different
        repository locations.  However, Subversion
        <span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> show that the two files share a
        common history.  Before the branch copy was made in revision
        341, the files used to be the same file.  That's why you and
        Sally both see the changes made in revisions 303 and

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>You should remember two important lessons
        from this section.  First, Subversion has no internal concept
        of a branch—it knows only how to make copies.  When you
        copy a directory, the resultant directory is only
        a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">branch</span>”</span> because <span class="emphasis"><em>you</em></span>
        attach that meaning to it.  You may think of the directory
        differently, or treat it differently, but to Subversion it's
        just an ordinary directory that happens to carry some extra
        historical information.</p>
        <p>Second, because of this copy mechanism, Subversion's
        branches exist as <span class="emphasis"><em>normal filesystem
        directories</em></span> in the repository.  This is different
        from other version control systems, where branches are
        typically defined by adding
        extra-dimensional <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">labels</span>”</span> to collections of
        files.  The location of your branch directory doesn't matter
        to Subversion.  Most teams follow a convention of putting all
        branches into a <code class="filename">/branches</code> directory, but
        you're free to invent any policy you wish.</p>
