# Python-AWIPS

The **python-awips** package provides a data access framework for requesting meteorological and related datasets from an EDEX server.  As with any python code, python-awips can be used to interact in command line, or scripting form, with the EDEX.  This is an alternative to using CAVE to interact with the data.

[**Thorough documentation for python-awips can be found here**](http://unidata.github.io/python-awips/).
