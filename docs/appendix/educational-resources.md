# Educational Resources

Here at Unidata, we want to provide as many resources as possible to make our tools and applications easy to use.  For AWIPS we currently have a new [eLearning course](#cave-elearning-course) that is specific to CAVE.  We also have a suite of [Jupyter Notebooks](#python-awips-example-notebooks) that are meant to provide a detailed overview of many capabilities of python-awips.

## Python-AWIPS Example Notebooks

In addition to CAVE, AWIPS also has a Python package called ***python-awips*** which allows access to all data on an EDEX server.  We have created a suite of Jupyter Notebooks as examples for how to use various functions of python-awips.

### Access

All of our Notebooks can be downloaded and accessed locally by following the <a href="http://unidata.github.io/python-awips/#source-code-with-examples-install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> source code installation instructions</a> found on our [python-awips website](http://unidata.github.io/python-awips/).

![GOES CIRA Notebook Example](../images/goesCiraNotebook.png)

Additionally, non-interactive [webpage renderings](http://unidata.github.io/python-awips/examples/index.html) of each of the Notebooks are also available for quick and easy references.

### Content

Our python-awips Notebooks span a wide range of topics, but generally cover the following:

- Investigating what data is available on an EDEX server
- Accessing and filtering desired data based on time and location
- Plotting and analyzing datasets
- Specific examples for various data types: satellite imagery, model data, soundings, surface obs, and more
