# Educational Resources

Here at Unidata, we want to provide as many resources as possible to make our tools and applications easy to use.  For AWIPS we currently have a new [eLearning course](#cave-elearning-course) that is specific to CAVE.  We also have a suite of [Jupyter Notebooks](#python-awips-example-notebooks) that are meant to provide a detailed overview of many capabilities of python-awips.
