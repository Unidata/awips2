# Educational Resources

Here at Unidata, we want to provide as many resources as possible to make our tools and applications easy to use.  For AWIPS we currently have a new [eLearning course](#cave-elearning-course) that is specific to CAVE.  We also have a suite of [Jupyter Notebooks](#python-awips-example-notebooks) that are meant to provide a detailed overview of many capabilities of python-awips.

### Design

*Learn AWIPS CAVE* is designed for those new to AWIPS or for those seeking to learn best practices. The course is organized into modular sections with supporting lessons, allowing for spaced learning or completion in multiple class or lab sessions. Each section concludes with a quiz to assess learning, and results can be requested by instructors or supervisors for their classes/teams. Below is a snapshot taken from the course.

## Python-AWIPS Example Notebooks

In addition to CAVE, AWIPS also has a Python package called ***python-awips*** which allows access to all data on an EDEX server.  We have created a suite of Jupyter Notebooks as examples for how to use various functions of python-awips.

### Access

All of our Notebooks can be downloaded and accessed locally by following the <a href="http://unidata.github.io/python-awips/#source-code-with-examples-install" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> source code installation instructions</a> found on our [python-awips website](http://unidata.github.io/python-awips/).

Additionally, non-interactive [webpage renderings](http://unidata.github.io/python-awips/examples/index.html) of each of the Notebooks are also available for quick and easy references.

### Content

Our python-awips Notebooks span a wide range of topics, but generally cover the following:

- Investigating what data is available on an EDEX server
- Accessing and filtering desired data based on time and location
- Plotting and analyzing datasets
- Specific examples for various data types: satellite imagery, model data, soundings, surface obs, and more
