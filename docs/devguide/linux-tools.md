Several standard Linux tools can be used to monitor the EDEX  processes, and for the purposes of this document and the Unidata AWIPS Training Workshop, it is assumed that all are available and that the user has some knowledge of how they are used.  Regardless, this document includes the full command syntax that can be copy and pasted from the document to the terminal.


* **ps** - Display information about specific processes 
    
        ps aux | grep edex

* **cat** - Used to display a text file in a terminal 

        cat /awips2/ldm/etc/pqact.conf

* **tail** - Used to provide a dynamic picture of process logs 

        tail -f /awips2/ldm/logs/ldmd.conf
  
* **grep** - Used to filter content of process logs; used to filter output of other tools 

        grep edexBridge /awips2/ldm/etc/ldmd.conf

* **top** - Provides a dynamic view of the memory and cpu usage of the EDEX processes 

* **psql** - A terminal-based front-end to PostgreSQL.  We will be executing SQL queries.  You do not need to have previous experience with SQL to follow this guide, but navigating AWIPS metadata is made much easier with some experience.

        [awips@edex ~]$ psql metadata
        Type "help" for help.
        
        metadata=# help
        You are using psql, the command-line interface to PostgreSQL.
        Type:  \copyright for distribution terms
               \h for help with SQL commands
               \? for help with psql commands
               \g or terminate with semicolon to execute query
               \q to quit
               
        metadata=# \dt sat*
