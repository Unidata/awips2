# Product Generator (PGEN)

The National Centers use PGEN to draw annotations and generate all their products, and it is included in D-2D to support Center Weather Service Units (CWSUs) making AWC-style SIGMETs. While this is not intended to be used for other purposes, there are a number of unique drawing and annotation tools that can be used to make images using the CAVE->export->Image once a display has been created.
