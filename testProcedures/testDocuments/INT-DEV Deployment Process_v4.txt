Scripts and steps for deploying the DEV nightly build 

1.Preparation
	
	Stop AlertViz
	Stop CAVE
	rm -Rf caveData

NOTE:	You must be logged in as 'root' to execute the following steps.
****


2.Delete existing AWIPS

	yum clean all;export http_proxy=;yum --disablerepo=* remove awips2\*

3.Verify that the /awipsShare-nightly and  /awips2 folders are empty or  do not exist

	umount /awipsShare-nightly
	ls /awipsShare-nightly

	rm -Rf /awips2
	ls /awips2 -- tobe sure the directory has been removed

4.Installation of DEV

	yum clean all;export http_proxy=;yum --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=awips2-dev groupinstall 'AWIPS II Visualize' 'AWIPS II Rehost Server'

5.At this point there should be a new /awips2 folder (specific to your account for your session)

6.Execute the following command in the terminal session in order to set up the symbolic links

	ln -s /data-int/hdf5/ /awips2/edex/data/hdf5;ll /awips2/edex/data/hdf5 (EDEX_HOME)

	mount dx3-oma:/awips-share /awipsShare-nightly
	ln -s /awipsShare-nightly /awips2/awipsShare (awipsShare)	

	
7.Execute the following commands to populate the cave.sh and gfecliet.sh with the HYDRO_APPS_DIR information

	perl -p -i -e "s/HYDRO_APPS_DIR=\"\"/HYDRO_APPS_DIR=\"\/awips2\/awipsShare\/hydroapps\"/g" /awips2/cave/cave.sh
	perl -p -i -e "s/HYDRO_APPS_DIR=\"\"/HYDRO_APPS_DIR=\"\/awips2\/awipsShare\/hydroapps\"/g" /awips2/GFESuite/bin/gfeclient.sh
	grep HYDRO /awips2/cave/cave.sh;grep HYDRO /awips2/GFESuite/bin/gfeclient.sh

Or edit /awips2/cave/cave.sh to add Hydro Dir settings

INT:	Hydro Dir (int) = /data-int/hdf5/hydroapps
DEV:	Hydro Dir (dev) = /data-dev/hdf5/hydroapps

8.Execute the following command to verify the version of the deployed build 

rpm -qa|grep -i awips2-cave |wc -l

****there should be 32 cave packages


9.Execute the following command to check whether /data-int has been mounted

mount |grep int;cd /data-int;ls;cd
			
****this will list out all existing mounts, confirm the /data-int is mounted (mount)
****ensure that you can access the directory (cd)
****ensure that the directory /hdf5 folder exists (ls)

10.If necessary, execute the following command to mount /data-int or /data-dev if the mount does not exist

mount /data-int

11.Enter **** exit **** at the terminal window to close the root session
