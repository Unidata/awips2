Scripts and steps for deploying the DEV nightly build 

1.Either backup or remove caveData from your home directory 

	rm -Rf caveData

NOTE:	You must be logged in as 'root' to execute these processed.



2.Delete existing AWIPS

	yum clean all;export http_proxy=;yum --disablerepo=* remove awips2\*

3.Verify that the /awips2 folder does not exist

	rm -Rf /awips2/*
	rm -Rf /usr/local/viz/*
	
	Note:  The --bind mount will persist

	ll /awips2;ll /usr/local/viz/  -- tobe sure the directory has been removed

Optional: [if /usr/local/viz or /awips2 do not exist]
**************************************************************
	mkdir /usr/local/viz
	mkdir /awips2

	chown awips:fxalpha /usr/local/viz
	chown awips:fxalpha /awips2
**************************************************************

	umount /awipsShare-nightly
	ls /awipsShare-nightly

4.Installation of INT and DEV

	yum clean all;export http_proxy=;yum --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=awips2-dev groupinstall 'AWIPS II Visualize' 'AWIPS II Rehost Server'

5.At this point there should be a new /awips2 folder (specific to your account for your session)

6.Execute the following command in the terminal session in order to set up the symbolic link for EDEX_HOME

	ln -s /data-int/hdf5/ /awips2/edex/data/hdf5;ll /awips2/edex/data/hdf5 
	mount dx3-oma:/awips-share /awipsShare-nightly

        ln -s /awipsShare-nightly /awips2/edex/data/share

7.Execute the following commands to populate the cave.sh and gfecliet.sh with the HYDRO_APPS_DIR information

	perl -p -i -e "s/HYDRO_APPS_DIR=\"\"/HYDRO_APPS_DIR=\"\/awips2\/awipsShare\/hydroapps\"/g" /awips2/cave/cave.sh
	perl -p -i -e "s/HYDRO_APPS_DIR=\"\"/HYDRO_APPS_DIR=\"\/awips2\/awipsShare\/hydroapps\"/g" /awips2/GFESuite/bin/gfeclient.sh
	grep HYDRO /awips2/cave/cave.sh;grep HYDRO /awips2/GFESuite/bin/gfeclient.sh

Or edit /awips2/cave/cave.sh to add Hydro Dir settings

DEV:	Hydro Dir (dev) = /data-dev/hdf5/hydroapps

8.Execute the following command to verify the version of the deployed build

rpm -qa|grep -i awips2-cave |wc -l  -- there should be 32 cave packages

9.Execute the following command to check whether /data-int has been mounted

mount |grep int;cd /data-int;ls;cd			
                        {this will list out all existing mounts, confirm the /data-int or /data-int are mounted}
			{ensures that you can access the directory}
			{ensures that the directory /hdf5 folder exists}

10.If necessary, execute the following command to mount /data-int or /data-dev if the mount does not exist

mount / data-dev

or

mount /data-int

11.Enter 'exit' at the terminal window to close the root session

12.  While localized to LWX the following apply.

The development cluster (dx1-oma, dx3-oma, and dx4-oma) is now localized to LWX. So, before you start CAVE, you will need to:
Remove your caveData directory (~/caveData) - done in step 1

Then, after you start CAVE, when the Connectivity Preferences dialog opens:
Set the Localization Server to: http://ts1-oma:9581/services
Set the Site to: LWX
Click Validate
Click OK

Once CAVE starts:
Go to: CAVE -> Preferences ...
Click on "Hydro Apps"
Set the Database Connection String to: jdbc:postgresql://dx1-oma:5432/hd_ob92lwx?user=awips&password=awips
Click Apply
Click OK
