      <p>We copy, move, rename, and completely replace files and
      directories on our computers all the time.  And your version
      control system shouldn't get in the way of your doing these
      things with your version-controlled files and directories,
      either.  Subversion's file management support is quite
      liberating, affording almost as much flexibility for versioned
      files as you'd expect when manipulating your unversioned ones.
      But that flexibility means that across the lifetime of your
      repository, a given versioned object might have many paths, and
      a given path might represent several entirely different
      versioned objects.  This introduces a certain level of
      complexity to your interactions with those paths and
      objects.</p>
      <p>Subversion is pretty smart about noticing when an object's
      version history includes such <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">changes of address.</span>”</span>
      For example, if you ask for the revision history log of a
      particular file that was renamed last week, Subversion happily
      provides all those logs—the revision in which the rename
      itself happened, plus the logs of relevant revisions both before
      and after that rename.  So, most of the time, you don't even
      have to think about such things.  But occasionally, Subversion
      needs your help to clear up ambiguities.</p>
      <p>The simplest example of this occurs when a directory or file
      is deleted from version control, and then a new directory or
      file is created with the same name and added to version control.
      The thing you deleted and the thing you later added aren't the
      same thing.  They merely happen to have had the same
      path—<code class="filename">/trunk/object</code>, for example.
      What, then, does it mean to ask Subversion about the history of
      <code class="filename">/trunk/object</code>?  Are you asking about the
      thing currently at that location, or the old thing you deleted
      from that location?  Are you asking about the operations that
      have happened to <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span> the objects that have
      ever lived at that path?  Subversion needs a hint about what you
      really want.</p>
      <p>And thanks to moves, versioned object history can get far
      more twisted than even that.  For example, you might have a
      directory named <code class="filename">concept</code>, containing some
      nascent software project you've been toying with.  Eventually,
      though, that project matures to the point that the idea seems to
      actually have some wings, so you do the unthinkable and decide
      to give the project a name.<sup>[<a id="idp33989264" href="#ftn.idp33989264" class="footnote">9</a>]</sup>
      Let's say you called your software Frabnaggilywort.  At this
      point, it makes sense to rename the directory to reflect the
      project's new name, so <code class="filename">concept</code> is renamed
      to <code class="filename">frabnaggilywort</code>.  Life goes on,
      Frabnaggilywort releases a 1.0 version and is downloaded and
      used daily by hordes of people aiming to improve their
      lives.</p>
      <p>It's a nice story, really, but it doesn't end there.
      Entrepreneur that you are, you've already got another think in
      the tank.  So you make a new directory,
      <code class="filename">concept</code>, and the cycle begins again.  In
      fact, the cycle begins again many times over the years, each
      time starting with that old <code class="filename">concept</code>
      directory, then sometimes seeing that directory renamed as the
      idea cures, sometimes seeing it deleted when you scrap the idea.
      Or, to get really sick, maybe you rename
      <code class="filename">concept</code> to something else for a while, but
      later rename the thing back to <code class="filename">concept</code> for
      some reason.</p>
      <p>In scenarios like these, attempting to instruct
      Subversion to work with these reused paths can be a little like
      instructing a motorist in Chicago's West Suburbs to drive east
      down Roosevelt Road and turn left onto Main Street.  In a mere
      20 minutes, you can cross <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Main Street</span>”</span> in
      Wheaton, Glen Ellyn, and Lombard.  And no, they aren't the same
      street.  Our motorist—and our Subversion—need a
      little more detail to do the right thing.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, Subversion allow you to tell it exactly which
      Main Street you meant.  The mechanism used is called a
      <em class="firstterm">peg revision</em>, and you provide these to
      Subversion for the sole purpose of identifying unique lines of
      history.  Because at most one versioned object may occupy a path
      at any given time—or, more precisely, in any one
      revision—the combination of a path and a peg revision is
      all that is needed to unambiguously identify to a specific line
      of history.  Peg revisions are specified to the Subversion
      command-line client using <em class="firstterm">at syntax</em>, so
      called because the syntax involves appending an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">at
      sign</span>”</span> (<code class="literal">@</code>) and the peg revision to the
      end of the path with which the revision is associated.</p>
      <p>But what of the <code class="option">--revision</code>
      (<code class="option">-r</code>) of which we've spoken so much in this
      book?  That revision (or set of revisions) is called the
      <em class="firstterm">operative revision</em> (or
      <em class="firstterm">operative revision range</em>).  Once a
      particular line of history has been identified using a path and
      peg revision, Subversion performs the requested operation using
      the operative revision(s).  To map this to our Chicagoland
      streets analogy, if we are told to go to 606 N. Main Street in
      Wheaton,<sup>[<a id="idp34002656" href="#ftn.idp34002656" class="footnote">10</a>]</sup> we can think
      of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Main Street</span>”</span> as our path and
      <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Wheaton</span>”</span> as our peg revision.  These two pieces of
      information identify a unique path that can be traveled (north or
      south on Main Street), and they keep us from traveling up and
      down the wrong Main Street in search of our destination.  Now we
      throw in <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">606 N.</span>”</span> as our operative revision of
      sorts, and we know <span class="emphasis"><em>exactly</em></span> where to
      go.</p>
      <div class="sidebar" title="The Peg Revision Algorithm">
        <p class="title">
          <b>The Peg Revision Algorithm</b>
        </p>
        <p>The Subversion command-line client performs the peg revision
        algorithm any time it needs to resolve possible ambiguities in
        the paths and revisions provided to it.  Here's an example of
        such an invocation:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn <em class="replaceable"><code>command</code></em> -r <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em> item@<em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>If <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em> is older than
        <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>, the algorithm is as
        follows:</p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Locate <em class="replaceable"><code>item</code></em> in the revision
            identified by <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>.  There
            can be only one such object.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Trace the object's history backwards (through any
            possible renames) to its ancestor in the revision
            <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Perform the requested action on that ancestor,
            wherever it is located, or whatever its name might
            be or might have been at that time.</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>But what if <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em> is
        <span class="emphasis"><em>younger</em></span> than
        <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>?  Well, that adds some
        complexity to the theoretical problem of locating the path in
        <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>, because the path's
        history could have forked multiple times (thanks to copy
        operations) between <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em> and
        <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.  And that's not
        all—Subversion doesn't store enough information to
        performantly trace an object's history forward, anyway.  So
        the algorithm is a little different:</p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Locate <em class="replaceable"><code>item</code></em> in the revision
            identified by <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.  There
            can be only one such object.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Trace the object's history backward (through any
            possible renames) to its ancestor in the revision
            <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em>.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Verify that the object's location (path-wise) in
            <em class="replaceable"><code>PEG-REV</code></em> is the same as it is in
            <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.  If that's the
            case, at least the two locations are known to be
            directly related, so perform the requested action on the
            location in <em class="replaceable"><code>OPERATIVE-REV</code></em>.
            Otherwise, relatedness was not established, so error out
            with a loud complaint that no viable location was found.
            (Someday, we expect that Subversion will be able to handle
            this usage scenario with more flexibility and
            grace.)</p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>Note that even when you don't explicitly supply a peg
        revision or operative revision, they are still present.  For
        your convenience, the default peg revision is
        <code class="literal">BASE</code> for working copy items and
        <code class="literal">HEAD</code> for repository URLs.  And when no
        operative revision is provided, it defaults to being the same
        revision as the peg revision.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Say that long ago we created our repository, and in revision 1
      we added our first <code class="filename">concept</code> directory, plus an
      <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file in that directory talking about
      the concept.  After several revisions in which real code was
      added and tweaked, we, in revision 20, renamed this directory to
      <code class="filename">frabnaggilywort</code>.  By revision 27, we had a
      new concept, a new <code class="filename">concept</code> directory to
      hold it, and a new <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file to describe
      it.  And then five years and thousands of revisions flew by,
      just like they would in any good romance story.</p>
      <p>Now, years later, we wonder what the
      <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file looked like back in revision 1.
      But Subversion needs to know whether we are asking about how the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>current</em></span> file looked back in revision 1, or
      whether we are asking for the contents of whatever file lived at
      <code class="filename">concepts/IDEA</code> in revision 1.  Certainly
      those questions have different answers, and because of peg
      revisions, you can ask those questions.  To find out how the
      current <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file looked in that old
      revision, you run:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn cat -r 1 concept/IDEA 
svn: Unable to find repository location for 'concept/IDEA' in revision 1
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Of course, in this example, the current
      <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file didn't exist yet in revision 1,
      so Subversion gives an error.  The previous command is shorthand
      for a longer notation which explicitly lists a peg revision.
      The expanded notation is:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn cat -r 1 concept/IDEA@BASE
svn: Unable to find repository location for 'concept/IDEA' in revision 1
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>And when executed, it has the expected results.</p>
      <p>The perceptive reader is probably wondering at this point whether
      the peg revision syntax causes problems for working copy paths
      or URLs that actually have at signs in them.  After
      all, how does <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> know whether
      <code class="literal">news@11</code> is the name of a directory in my
      tree or just a syntax for <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">revision 11 of
      <code class="filename">news</code></span>”</span>?  Thankfully, while
      <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> will always assume the latter, there is a
      trivial workaround.  You need only append an at sign to the
      end of the path, such as <code class="literal">news@11@</code>.
      <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> cares only about the last at sign in
      the argument, and it is not considered illegal to omit a literal
      peg revision specifier after that at sign.  This workaround
      even applies to paths that end in an at sign—you would
      use <code class="literal">filename@@</code> to talk about a file named
      <code class="filename">filename@</code>.</p>
      <p>Let's ask the other question, then—in revision 1, what
      were the contents of whatever file occupied the address
      <code class="filename">concepts/IDEA</code> at the time?  We'll use an
      explicit peg revision to help us out.</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ svn cat concept/IDEA@1
The idea behind this project is to come up with a piece of software
that can frab a naggily wort.  Frabbing naggily worts is tricky
business, and doing it incorrectly can have serious ramifications, so
we need to employ over-the-top input validation and data verification
mechanisms.
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>Notice that we didn't provide an operative revision this
      time.  That's because when no operative revision is specified,
      Subversion assumes a default operative revision that's the same
      as the peg revision.</p>
      <p>As you can see, the output from our operation appears to be
      correct.  The text even mentions frabbing naggily worts, so this
      is almost certainly the file that describes the software now
      called Frabnaggilywort.  In fact, we can verify this using the
      combination of an explicit peg revision and explicit operative
      revision.  We know that in <code class="literal">HEAD</code>, the
      Frabnaggilywort project is located in the
      <code class="filename">frabnaggilywort</code> directory.  So we specify
      that we want to see how the line of history identified in
      <code class="literal">HEAD</code> as the path
      <code class="filename">frabnaggilywort/IDEA</code> looked in revision
      1.</p>

      <p>And the peg and operative revisions need not be so trivial,
      either.  For example, say <code class="filename">frabnaggilywort</code>
      had been deleted from <code class="literal">HEAD</code>, but we know it
      existed in revision 20, and we want to see the diffs for its

      can use the peg revision 20 in conjunction with the URL that
      would have held Frabnaggilywort's <code class="filename">IDEA</code> file
