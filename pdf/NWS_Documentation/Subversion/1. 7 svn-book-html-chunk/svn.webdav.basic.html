          </div>

      </div>
      <p>While the Subversion client is not a full DeltaV client, and
      the Subversion server is not a full DeltaV server, there's still a
      glimmer of WebDAV interoperability to be happy about:
      <em class="firstterm">autoversioning</em>.</p>
      <p>Autoversioning is an optional feature defined in the DeltaV
      standard.  A typical DeltaV server will reject an ignorant
      WebDAV client attempting to do a <code class="literal">PUT</code> to a
      file that's under version control.  To change a
      version-controlled file, the server expects a series of proper
      versioning requests: something like
      <code class="literal">MKACTIVITY</code>, <code class="literal">CHECKOUT</code>,
      <code class="literal">PUT</code>, <code class="literal">CHECKIN</code>.  But if the
      DeltaV server supports autoversioning, write requests from
      basic WebDAV clients are accepted.  The server behaves as though the
      client <span class="emphasis"><em>had</em></span> issued the proper series of
      versioning requests, performing a commit under the hood.  In
      other words, it allows a DeltaV server to interoperate with
      ordinary WebDAV clients that don't understand versioning.</p>
      <p>Because so many operating systems already have integrated
      WebDAV clients, the use case for this feature can be incredibly
      appealing to administrators working with non-technical users.
      Imagine an office of ordinary users running Microsoft Windows or
      Mac OS.  Each user <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mounts</span>”</span> the Subversion
      repository, which appears to be an ordinary network folder.
      They use the shared folder as they always do:  open files, edit
      them, and save them.  Meanwhile, the server is automatically
      versioning everything.  Any administrator (or knowledgeable
      user) can still use a Subversion client to search history and
      retrieve older versions of data.</p>
      <p>This scenario isn't fiction—it's real and it works.
      To activate autoversioning in <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>,
      use the <code class="literal">SVNAutoversioning</code> directive within
      the <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> <code class="literal">Location</code>
      block, like so:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
  SVNAutoversioning on
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>When Subversion autoversioning is active, write requests
      from WebDAV clients result in automatic commits.  A generic log
      message is automatically generated and attached to each
      revision.</p>
      <p>Before activating this feature, however, understand what
      you're getting into.  WebDAV clients tend to do
      <span class="emphasis"><em>many</em></span> write requests, resulting in a huge
      number of automatically committed revisions.  For example, when
      saving data, many clients will do a <code class="literal">PUT</code> of a
      0-byte file (as a way of reserving a name) followed by another
      <code class="literal">PUT</code> with the real file data.  The single
      file-write results in two separate commits.  Also consider that
      many applications auto-save every few minutes, resulting in even
      more commits.</p>
      <p>If you have a post-commit hook program that sends email, you
      may want to disable email generation either altogether or on
      certain sections of the repository; it depends on whether you
      think the influx of emails will still prove to be valuable
      notifications or not.  Also, a smart post-commit hook program
      can distinguish between a transaction created via autoversioning
      and one created through a normal Subversion commit operation.
      The trick is to look for a revision property
      named <code class="literal">svn:autoversioned</code>.  If present, the
      commit was made by a generic WebDAV client.</p>
      <p>Another feature that may be a useful complement for
      Subversion's autoversioning comes from Apache's
      <code class="literal">mod_mime</code> module.  If a WebDAV client adds a
      new file to the repository, there's no opportunity for the user
      to set the the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property.  This
      might cause the file to appear as a generic icon when viewed
      within a WebDAV shared folder, not having an association with
      any application.  One remedy is to have a sysadmin (or other
      Subversion-knowledgeable person) check out a working copy and
      manually set the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property on
      necessary files.  But there's potentially no end to such cleanup
      tasks.  Instead, you can use the
      <code class="literal">ModMimeUsePathInfo</code> directive in your
      Subversion <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
  SVNAutoversioning on

  ModMimeUsePathInfo on

&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
      </div>
      <p>This directive allows <code class="literal">mod_mime</code> to attempt
      automatic deduction of the MIME type on new files that enter the
      repository via autoversioning.  The module looks at the file's
      named extension and possibly the contents as well; if the file
      matches some common patterns, the
      file's <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property will be set
      automatically.</p>
