      <p>You can get new files into your Subversion
      repository in two ways: <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn
      add</strong></span>.  We'll discuss <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> now
      and will discuss <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> later in this
      chapter when we review a typical day with Subversion.</p>
      <div class="sect2" title="Importing Files and Directories">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.importing.import"></a>Importing Files and Directories</h3>

        </div>
        <a id="idp32687664" class="indexterm"></a>
        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> command is a quick way to
        copy an unversioned tree of files into a repository, creating
        intermediate directories as necessary.  <span class="command"><strong>svn
        import</strong></span> doesn't require a working copy, and your files
        are immediately committed to the repository.  You typically
        use this when you have an existing tree of files that you want to
        begin tracking in your Subversion repository.  For example:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn import /path/to/mytree \
             http://svn.example.com/svn/repo/some/project \
             -m "Initial import"
Adding         mytree/foo.c
Adding         mytree/bar.c
Adding         mytree/subdir
Adding         mytree/subdir/quux.h

Committed revision 1.
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>The previous example copied the contents of the local
        directory <code class="filename">mytree</code> into the directory
        <code class="filename">some/project</code> in the repository.  Note
        that you didn't have to create that new directory
        first—<span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span> does that for you.
        Immediately after the commit, you can see your data in the
        repository:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn list http://svn.example.com/svn/repo/some/project
bar.c
foo.c
subdir/
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Note that after the import is finished, the original local
        directory is <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> converted into a working
        copy.  To begin working on that data in a versioned fashion,
        you still need to create a fresh working copy of that
        tree.</p>

        <p>Subversion provides the ultimate flexibility in terms of
        how you arrange your data.  Because it simply versions
        directories and files, and because it ascribes no particular
        meaning to any of those objects, you may arrange the data in
        your repository in any way that you choose.  Unfortunately,
        this flexibility also means that it's easy to find
        yourself <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">lost without a roadmap</span>”</span> as you attempt
        to navigate different Subversion repositories which may carry
        completely different and unpredictable arrangements of the
        data within them.</p>
        <p>To counteract this confusion, we recommend that you follow
        a repository layout convention (established long ago, in the
        nascency of the Subversion project itself) in which a handful
        of strategically named Subversion repository directories
        convey valuable meaning about the data they hold.  Most
        projects have a recognizable <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">main line</span>”</span>,
        or <em class="firstterm">trunk</em>, of development;
        some <em class="firstterm">branches</em>, which are divergent
        copies of development lines; and
        some <em class="firstterm">tags</em>, which are named, stable
        snapshots of a particular line of development.  So we first
        recommend that each project have a
        recognizable <em class="firstterm">project root</em> in the
        repository, a directory under which all of the versioned
        information for that project—and only that
        project—lives.  Secondly, we suggest that each project
        root contain a <code class="filename">trunk</code> subdirectory for the
        main development line, a
        <code class="filename">branches</code> subdirectory in which specific
        branches (or collections of branches) will be created, and
        a <code class="filename">tags</code> subdirectory in which specific
        tags (or collections of tags) will be created.  Of course, if
        a repository houses only a single project, the root of the
        repository can serve as the project root, too.</p>
        <p>Here are some examples:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn list file:///var/svn/single-project-repo
/trunk
/branches
/tags
$ svn list file:///var/svn/multi-project-repo
/project-A
/project-B
$ svn list file:///var/svn/multi-project-repo/project-A
/trunk
/branches
/tags
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>We talk much more about tags and branches in
        <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.html" title="Chapter 4. Branching and Merging">Chapter 4, <i>Branching and Merging</i></a>.  For details and some
        advice on how to set up repositories when you have multiple
        projects, see <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.maint.html#svn.branchmerge.maint.layout" title="Repository Layout">the section called “Repository Layout”</a>.
        Finally, we discuss project roots more in
        <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.planning.html#svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout" title="Planning Your Repository Organization">the section called “Planning Your Repository Organization”</a>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" title="What's In a Name?">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>

        <p>Subversion tries hard not to limit the type of data you
        can place under version control.  The contents of files and
        property values are stored and transmitted as binary data, and
        <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="File Content Type">the section called “File Content Type”</a>
        tells you how to give Subversion a hint that
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">textual</span>”</span> operations don't make sense for a
        particular file.  There are a few places, however, where
        Subversion places restrictions on information it
        stores.</p>
        <p>Subversion internally handles certain bits of
        data—for example, property names, pathnames, and log
        messages—as UTF-8-encoded Unicode.  This is not to say
        that all your interactions with Subversion must involve UTF-8,
        though.  As a general rule, Subversion clients will gracefully
        and transparently handle conversions between UTF-8 and the
        encoding system in use on your computer, if such a conversion
        can meaningfully be done (which is the case for most common
        encodings in use today).</p>
        <p>In WebDAV exchanges and older versions of some of
        Subversion's administrative files, paths are used as XML
        attribute values, and property names in XML tag names.  This
        means that pathnames can contain only legal XML (1.0)
        characters, and properties are further limited to ASCII
        characters.  Subversion also prohibits <code class="literal">TAB</code>,
        <code class="literal">CR</code>, and <code class="literal">LF</code> characters in
        path names to prevent paths from being broken up in diffs or
        in the output of commands such as <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span>
        or <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span>.</p>
        <p>While it may seem like a lot to remember, in practice
        these limitations are rarely a problem.  As long as your
        locale settings are compatible with UTF-8 and you don't use
        control characters in path names, you should have no trouble
        communicating with Subversion.  The command-line client adds
        an extra bit of help—to create
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">legally correct</span>”</span> versions for internal
        use it will automatically escape illegal
        path characters as needed in URLs that you type.</p>
