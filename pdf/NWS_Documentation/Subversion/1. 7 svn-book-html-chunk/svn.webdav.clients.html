        <p>A WebDAV application is a program that speaks WebDAV
        protocols with a WebDAV server.  We'll cover some of the most
        popular programs with this kind of WebDAV support.</p>
        <div class="sect3" title="Microsoft Office, Dreamweaver, Photoshop">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>On Windows, several well-known applications contain
          integrated WebDAV client functionality, such as Microsoft's
          Office,<sup>[<a id="idp48325632" href="#ftn.idp48325632" class="footnote">65</a>]</sup> Adobe's Photoshop and
          Dreamweaver programs.  They're able to directly open and
          save to URLs, and tend to make heavy use of WebDAV locks
          when editing a file.</p>
          <p>Note that while many of these programs also exist for
          Mac OS X, they do not appear to support WebDAV directly
          on that platform.  In fact, on Mac OS X, the
          <span class="guimenu">File→Open</span> dialog box doesn't allow
          one to type a path or URL at all.  It's likely that the
          WebDAV features were deliberately left out of Macintosh
          versions of these programs, since OS X already provides such
          excellent low-level filesystem support for WebDAV.</p>

          <p>cadaver is a bare-bones Unix command-line program for
          browsing and changing WebDAV shares.  Like the Subversion
          client, it uses the neon HTTP library—not
          surprisingly, since both neon and cadaver are written by the
          same author.  cadaver is free software (GPL license) and is
          available at
          <a class="ulink" href="http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/" target="_top">http://www.webdav.org/cadaver/</a>.</p>
          <p>Using cadaver is similar to using a command-line FTP
          program, and thus it's extremely useful for basic WebDAV
          debugging.  It can be used to upload or download files in a
          pinch, to examine properties, and to copy, move,
          lock, or unlock files:</p>

          <p>DAV Explorer is another standalone WebDAV client, written
          in Java.  It's under a free Apache-like license and is
          available at <a class="ulink" href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/" target="_top">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~webdav/</a>.
          It does everything cadaver does, but has the
          advantages of being portable and being a more user-friendly GUI
          application.  It's also one of the first clients to support
          the new WebDAV Access Control Protocol (RFC 3744).</p>
          <p>Of course, DAV Explorer's ACL support is useless in this
          case, since <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> doesn't support
          it.  The fact that both cadaver and DAV Explorer support
          some limited DeltaV commands isn't particularly useful
          either, since they don't allow <code class="literal">MKACTIVITY</code>
          requests.  But it's not relevant anyway; we're assuming all
          of these clients are operating against an autoversioning
          repository.</p>

        <p>Some popular file explorer GUI programs support WebDAV
        extensions that allow a user to browse a DAV share as though it
        was just another directory on the local computer, and to
        perform basic tree editing operations on the items in that
        share.  For example, Windows Explorer is able to browse a
        WebDAV server as a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">network place.</span>”</span>  Users can
        drag files to and from the desktop, or can rename, copy, or
        delete files in the usual way.  But because it's only a
        feature of the file explorer, the DAV share isn't visible to
        ordinary applications.  All DAV interaction must happen
        through the explorer interface.</p>

          <p>Microsoft was one of the original backers of the WebDAV
          specification, and first started shipping a client in
          Windows 98, which was known as Web Folders.  This client was
          also shipped in Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000.</p>
          <p>The original Web Folders client was an extension to
          Explorer, the main GUI program used to browse filesystems.  It
          works well enough.  In Windows 98, the feature might need to
          be explicitly installed if Web Folders aren't already visible
          inside My Computer.  In Windows 2000, simply
          add a new <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">network place,</span>”</span> enter the URL, and the
          WebDAV share will pop up for browsing.</p>
          <p>With the release of Windows XP, Microsoft started shipping
          a new implementation of Web Folders, known as the WebDAV
          Mini-Redirector.  The new implementation is a
          filesystem-level client, allowing WebDAV shares to be mounted
          as drive letters.  Unfortunately, this implementation is
          incredibly buggy.  The client usually tries to convert HTTP
          URLs (<code class="literal">http://host/repos</code>) into UNC share
          notation (<code class="literal">\\host\repos</code>); it also often
          tries to use Windows Domain authentication to respond to
          basic-auth HTTP challenges, sending usernames as
          <code class="literal">HOST\username</code>.  These interoperability
          problems are severe and are documented in numerous places around
          the Web, to the frustration of many users.  Even Greg Stein,
          the original author of Apache's WebDAV module, bluntly
          states that XP Web Folders simply can't operate against an Apache
          server.</p>
          <p>Windows Vista's initial implementation of Web Folders seems to
          be almost the same as XP's, so it has the same sort of
          problems.  With luck, Microsoft will remedy these issues in
          a Vista Service Pack.</p>
          <p>However, there seem to be workarounds for both XP and
          Vista that allow Web Folders to work against Apache.  Users
          have mostly reported success with these techniques, so we'll
          relay them here.</p>
          <p>On Windows XP, you have two options.  First, search
          Microsoft's web site for update KB907306, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Software
          Update for Web Folders.</span>”</span>  This may fix all your
          problems.  If it doesn't, it seems that the original pre-XP
          Web Folders implementation is still buried within the
          system.  You can unearth it by going to Network
          Places and adding a new network place.  When prompted,
          enter the URL of the repository, but <span class="emphasis"><em>include a
          port number</em></span> in the URL.  For
          example, you should enter <strong class="userinput"><code>http://host/repos</code></strong> 
          as <strong class="userinput"><code>http://host:80/repos</code></strong> instead.
          Respond to any authentication prompts with your Subversion
          credentials.</p>
          <p>On Windows Vista, the same KB907306 update may clear
          everything up.  But there may still be other issues.  Some
          users have reported that Vista considers
          all <code class="literal">http://</code> connections insecure, and thus
          will always fail any authentication challenges from Apache
          unless the connection happens
          over <code class="literal">https://</code>.  If you're unable to connect
          to the Subversion repository via SSL, you can tweak the
          system registry to turn off this behavior.  Just change the
          value of the <code class="literal">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WebClient\Parameters\BasicAuthLevel</code>
          key from <strong class="userinput"><code>1</code></strong> to <strong class="userinput"><code>2</code></strong>.  A final warning:  be sure to set up the Web
          Folder to point to the repository's root directory
          (<code class="filename">/</code>), rather than some subdirectory
          such as <code class="filename">/trunk</code>.  Vista Web Folders
          seems to work only against repository roots.</p>
          <p>In general, while these workarounds may function for
          you, you might get a better overall experience using a
          third-party WebDAV client such as WebDrive or NetDrive.</p>

          <p>Nautilus is the official file manager/browser for the
          GNOME desktop (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.gnome.org" target="_top">http://www.gnome.org</a>), and
          Konqueror is the manager/browser for the KDE desktop (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.kde.org" target="_top">http://www.kde.org</a>).  Both of these applications
          have an explorer-level WebDAV client built in, and they
          operate just fine against an autoversioning repository.</p>
          <p>In GNOME's Nautilus, select the <span class="guimenuitem">File→Open
          location</span> menu item and enter the URL in the
          dialog box presented.  The repository should then be
          displayed like any other filesystem.</p>
          <p>In KDE's Konqueror, you need to use the
          <code class="literal">webdav://</code> scheme when entering the URL in
          the location bar.  If you enter
          an <code class="literal">http://</code> URL, Konqueror will behave
          like an ordinary web browser.  You'll likely see the generic
          HTML directory listing produced
          by <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>.  When you enter
          <strong class="userinput"><code>webdav://host/repos</code></strong> instead of
          <strong class="userinput"><code>http://host/repos</code></strong>, Konqueror becomes a
          WebDAV client and displays the repository as a
          filesystem.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The WebDAV filesystem implementation is arguably the best
        sort of WebDAV client.  It's implemented as a low-level
        filesystem module, typically within the operating system's
        kernel.  This means that the DAV share is mounted like any
        other network filesystem, similar to mounting an NFS share on
        Unix or attaching an SMB share as a drive letter in Windows.
        As a result, this sort of client provides completely
        transparent read/write WebDAV access to all programs.
        Applications aren't even aware that WebDAV requests are
        happening.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Both WebDrive and NetDrive are excellent commercial
          products that allow a WebDAV share to be attached as drive
          letters in Windows.  As a result, you can operate on the
          contents of these WebDAV-backed pseudodrives as easily as
          you can against real local hard drives, and in the same
          ways.  You can purchase WebDrive from South River
          Technologies (<a class="ulink" href="http://www.southrivertech.com" target="_top">http://www.southrivertech.com</a>).
          Novell's NetDrive is freely available online, but requires
          users to have a NetWare license.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Apple's OS X operating system has an integrated
          filesystem-level WebDAV client.  From the Finder, select the
          <span class="guimenuitem">Go→Connect to Server</span> menu
          item.  Enter a WebDAV URL, and it appears as a disk on the
          desktop, just like any other mounted volume.  You can also
          mount a WebDAV share from the Darwin terminal by using the
          <code class="literal">webdav</code> filesystem type with the
          <span class="command"><strong>mount</strong></span> command:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ mount -t webdav http://svn.example.com/repos/project /some/mountpoint
$
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Note that if your <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> is
          older than version 1.2, OS X will refuse to mount the share
          as read/write; it will appear as read-only.  This is because
          OS X insists on locking support for read/write shares, and
          the ability to lock files first appeared in Subversion
          1.2.</p>
          <p>Also, OS X's WebDAV client can sometimes be overly
          sensitive to HTTP redirects.  If OS X is unable to mount the
          repository at all, you may need to enable
          the <code class="literal">BrowserMatch</code> directive in the Apache
          server's <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code>:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
BrowserMatch "^WebDAVFS/1.[012]" redirect-carefully
</pre>
