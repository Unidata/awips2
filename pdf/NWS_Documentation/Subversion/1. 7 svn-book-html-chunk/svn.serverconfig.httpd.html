      </div>
      <p>The Apache HTTP Server is a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">heavy-duty</span>”</span>
      network server that Subversion can leverage.  Via a custom
      module, <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> makes Subversion repositories
      available to clients via the WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, which is an
      extension to HTTP 1.1 (see <a class="ulink" href="http://www.webdav.org/" target="_top">http://www.webdav.org/</a>
      for more information).  This protocol takes the ubiquitous HTTP
      protocol that is the core of the World Wide Web, and adds
      writing—specifically, versioned
      writing—capabilities.  The result is a standardized,
      robust system that is conveniently packaged as part of the
      Apache 2.0 software, supported by numerous operating systems and
      third-party products, and doesn't require network administrators
      to open up yet another custom port.<sup>[<a id="idp39391872" href="#ftn.idp39391872" class="footnote">47</a>]</sup>  While an Apache-Subversion
      server has more features than <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span>, it's
      also a bit more difficult to set up.  With flexibility often
      comes more complexity.</p>
      <p>Much of the following discussion includes references to
      Apache configuration directives.  While some examples are given
      of the use of these directives, describing them in full is
      outside the scope of this chapter.  The Apache team maintains
      excellent documentation, publicly available on their web site at
      <a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org" target="_top">http://httpd.apache.org</a>.  For example, a general
      reference for the configuration directives is located at
      <a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/directives.html" target="_top">http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/mod/directives.html</a>.</p>
      <p>Also, as you make changes to your Apache setup, it is likely
      that somewhere along the way a mistake will be made.  If you are
      not already familiar with Apache's logging subsystem, you should
      become aware of it.  In your <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code>
      file are directives that specify the on-disk locations of the
      access and error logs generated by Apache (the
      <code class="literal">CustomLog</code> and <code class="literal">ErrorLog</code>
      directives, respectively).
      Subversion's <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> uses Apache's error
      logging interface as well.  You can always browse the contents
      of those files for information that might reveal the source of a
      problem that is not clearly noticeable otherwise.</p>

        <p>To network your repository over HTTP, you basically need
        four components, available in two packages.  You'll need
        Apache <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> 2.0 or newer, the
        <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav</strong></span> DAV module that comes with it,
        Subversion, and the <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>
        filesystem provider module distributed with Subversion.
        Once you have all of those components, the process of
        networking your repository is as simple as:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Getting httpd up and running with
            the <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav</strong></span> module</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Installing the <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> backend
            to <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav</strong></span>, which uses Subversion's
            libraries to access the repository</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Configuring your <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code>
            file to export (or expose) the repository</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>You can accomplish the first two items either by
        compiling <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> and Subversion from
        source code or by installing prebuilt binary packages of
        them on your system.  For the most up-to-date information on
        how to compile Subversion for use with the Apache HTTP Server,
        as well as how to compile and configure Apache itself for
        this purpose, see the <code class="filename">INSTALL</code> file in
        the top level of the Subversion source code tree.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" title="Basic Apache Configuration">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.basic"></a>Basic Apache Configuration</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Once you have all the necessary components installed on
        your system, all that remains is the configuration of Apache
        via its <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> file.  Instruct Apache
        to load the <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> module using the
        <code class="literal">LoadModule</code> directive.  This directive must
        precede any other Subversion-related configuration items.  If
        your Apache was installed using the default layout, your
        <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> module should have been
        installed in the <code class="filename">modules</code> subdirectory of
        the Apache install location (often
        <code class="filename">/usr/local/apache2</code>).  The
        <code class="literal">LoadModule</code> directive has a simple syntax,
        mapping a named module to the location of a shared library on
        disk:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting">
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Apache interprets the <code class="literal">LoadModule</code>
        configuration item's library path as relative to its own
        server root.  If configured as previously shown, Apache will
        look for the Subversion DAV module shared library in its
        own <code class="filename">modules/</code> subdirectory.  Depending on
        how Subversion was installed on your system, you might need to
        specify a different path for this library altogether, perhaps
        even an absolute path such as in the following example:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting">
LoadModule dav_svn_module     C:/Subversion/lib/mod_dav_svn.so
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Note that if <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav</strong></span> was compiled as a
        shared object (instead of statically linked directly to the
        <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> binary), you'll need a similar
        <code class="literal">LoadModule</code> statement for it, too.  Be sure
        that it comes before the <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> line:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting">
LoadModule dav_module         modules/mod_dav.so
LoadModule dav_svn_module     modules/mod_dav_svn.so
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>At a later location in your configuration file, you now
        need to tell Apache where you keep your Subversion repository
        (or repositories).  The <code class="literal">Location</code> directive
        has an XML-like notation, starting with an opening tag and
        ending with a closing tag, with various other configuration
        directives in the middle.  The purpose of the
        <code class="literal">Location</code> directive is to instruct Apache to
        do something special when handling requests that are directed
        at a given URL or one of its children.  In the case of
        Subversion, you want Apache to simply hand off support for
        URLs that point at versioned resources to the DAV layer.  You
        can instruct Apache to delegate the handling of all URLs whose
        path portions (the part of the URL that follows the server's
        name and the optional port number) begin with
        <code class="filename">/repos/</code> to a DAV provider whose
        repository is located at
        <code class="filename">/var/svn/repository</code> using the
        following <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> syntax:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repository
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>If you plan to support multiple Subversion repositories
        that will reside in the same parent directory on your local
        disk, you can use an alternative
        directive—<code class="literal">SVNParentPath</code>—to
        indicate that common parent directory.  For example, if you
        know you will be creating multiple Subversion repositories in
        a directory <code class="filename">/var/svn</code> that would be
        accessed via URLs such as
        <code class="uri">http://my.server.com/svn/repos1</code>,
        <code class="uri">http://my.server.com/svn/repos2</code>, and so on, you
        could use the <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> configuration
        syntax in the following example:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn

  # Automatically map any "/svn/foo" URL to repository /var/svn/foo
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Using this syntax, Apache will delegate the
        handling of all URLs whose path portions begin with
        <code class="filename">/svn/</code> to the Subversion DAV provider,
        which will then assume that any items in the directory
        specified by the <code class="literal">SVNParentPath</code> directive
        are actually Subversion repositories.  This is a particularly
        convenient syntax in that, unlike the use of the
        <code class="literal">SVNPath</code> directive, you don't have to
        restart Apache to add or remove hosted repositories.</p>
        <p>Be sure that when you define your new
        <code class="literal">Location</code>, it doesn't overlap with other
        exported locations.  For example, if your main
        <code class="literal">DocumentRoot</code> is exported to
        <code class="filename">/www</code>, do not export a Subversion
        repository in <code class="literal">&lt;Location /www/repos&gt;</code>.
        If a request comes in for the URI
        <code class="filename">/www/repos/foo.c</code>, Apache won't know
        whether to look for a file <code class="filename">repos/foo.c</code> in
        the <code class="literal">DocumentRoot</code>, or whether to delegate
        <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> to return
        <code class="filename">foo.c</code> from the Subversion repository.
        The result is often an error from the server of the form
        <code class="literal">301 Moved Permanently</code>.</p>
        <div class="sidebar" title="Server Names and the COPY Request">
          <p class="title">
            <b>Server Names and the COPY Request</b>
          </p>
          <p>Subversion makes use of the <code class="literal">COPY</code>
          request type to perform server-side copies of files and
          directories.  As part of the sanity checking done by the
          Apache modules, the source of the copy is expected to be
          located on the same machine as the destination of the copy.
          To satisfy this requirement, you might need to
          tell <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav</strong></span> the name you use as the
          hostname of your server.  Generally, you can use
          the <code class="literal">ServerName</code> directive in
          <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> to accomplish this.</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
ServerName svn.example.com
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>If you are using Apache's virtual hosting support via
          the <code class="literal">NameVirtualHost</code> directive, you may
          need to use the <code class="literal">ServerAlias</code> directive to
          specify additional names by which your server is known.
          Again, refer to the Apache documentation for full
          details.</p>
        </div>
        <p>At this stage, you should strongly consider the question
        of permissions.  If you've been running Apache for some time
        now as your regular web server, you probably already have a
        collection of content—web pages, scripts, and such.
        These items have already been configured with a set of
        permissions that allows them to work with Apache, or more
        appropriately, that allows Apache to work with those files.
        Apache, when used as a Subversion server, will also need the
        correct permissions to read and write to your Subversion
        repository.</p>
        <p>You will need to determine a permission system setup that
        satisfies Subversion's requirements without messing up any
        previously existing web page or script installations.  This
        might mean changing the permissions on your Subversion
        repository to match those in use by other things that Apache
        serves for you, or it could mean using the
        <code class="literal">User</code> and <code class="literal">Group</code>
        directives in <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> to specify that
        Apache should run as the user and group that owns your
        Subversion repository.  There is no single correct way to set
        up your permissions, and each administrator will have
        different reasons for doing things a certain way.  Just be
        aware that permission-related problems are perhaps the most
        common oversight when configuring a Subversion repository for
        use with Apache.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" title="Authentication Options">
        <div class="titlepage">

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>At this point, if you configured
        <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> to contain something such as the
        following:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

</pre>
        </div>
        <p>your repository is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">anonymously</span>”</span>
        accessible to the world.  Until you configure some
        authentication and authorization policies, the Subversion
        repositories that you make available via the
        <code class="literal">Location</code> directive will be generally
        accessible to everyone.  In other words:</p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Anyone can use a Subversion client to check out a
            working copy of a repository URL (or any of its
            subdirectories).</p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Anyone can interactively browse the repository's

            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>Anyone can commit to the repository.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Of course, you might have already set up
        a <code class="filename">pre-commit</code> hook script to prevent
        commits (see <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.create.html#svn.reposadmin.create.hooks" title="Implementing Repository Hooks">the section called “Implementing Repository Hooks”</a>).
        But as you read on, you'll see that it's also possible to use
        Apache's built-in methods to restrict access in specific
        ways.</p>

</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Next, add some more directives inside the
          <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block to tell Apache how
          to use the password file:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # Authentication: Basic
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthType Basic
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth.htpasswd
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>These directives work as follows:</p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
              <li class="listitem">
                <p><code class="literal">AuthName</code> is an arbitrary name
              that you choose for the authentication domain.  Most
              browsers display this name in the dialog box when
              prompting for username and password.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p><code class="literal">AuthType</code> specifies the type of
              authentication to use.</p>
              </li>
              <li class="listitem">
                <p><code class="literal">AuthUserFile</code> specifies the
              location of the password file to use.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <p>However, this <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block
          doesn't yet do anything useful.  It merely tells Apache that
          <span class="emphasis"><em>if</em></span> authorization were required, it
          should challenge the Subversion client for a username and
          password.  (When authorization is required, Apache requires
          authentication as well.)  What's missing here, however, are
          directives that tell Apache <span class="emphasis"><em>which sorts</em></span>
          of client requests require authorization; currently, none do.
          The simplest thing is to specify that <span class="emphasis"><em>all</em></span>
          requests require authorization by adding
          <code class="literal">Require valid-user</code> to the block:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  AuthType Basic
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth.htpasswd

  # Authorization: Authenticated users only
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Refer to <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.httpd.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz" title="Authorization Options">the section called “Authorization Options”</a>
          for more detail on the <code class="literal">Require</code> directive
          and other ways to set authorization policies.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="sect3" title="Digest authentication">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authn.digest"></a>Digest authentication</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Digest authentication is an improvement on Basic
          authentication which allows the server to verify a client's
          identity without sending the password over the network
          unprotected.  Both client and server create a non-reversible
          MD5 hash of the username, password, requested URI, and a
          <em class="firstterm">nonce</em> (number used once) provided by
          the server and changed each time authentication is required.
          The client sends its hash to the server, and the server then
          verifies that the hashes match.</p>
          <p>Configuring Apache to use Digest authentication is
          straightforward, with only small variations on our prior
          example:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # Authentication: Digest
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthType Digest
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth.htdigest

  # Authorization: Authenticated users only
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Notice that <code class="literal">AuthType</code> is now set to
          <code class="literal">Digest</code>, and we specify a different path
          for <code class="literal">AuthUserFile</code>.  Digest authentication
          uses a different file format than Basic authentication;
          it is created using Apache's <span class="command"><strong>htdigest</strong></span>
          utility (<a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htdigest.html" target="_top">http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/programs/htdigest.html</a>)
          rather than <span class="command"><strong>htpasswd</strong></span>.
          Digest authentication also has the additional concept of a
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">realm</span>”</span>, which must match the value of the
          <code class="literal">AuthName</code> directive.  The password file
          can be created as follows:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ ### First time: use -c to create the file
$ htdigest -c /etc/svn-auth.htdigest "Subversion repository" harry
Adding password for harry in realm Subversion repository.
New password: *****
Re-type new password: *****
$ htdigest /etc/svn-auth.htdigest "Subversion repository" sally
Adding user sally in realm Subversion repository
New password: *******
Re-type new password: *******
$
</pre>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" title="Authorization Options">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz"></a>Authorization Options</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>At this point, you've configured authentication, but not
        authorization.  Apache is able to challenge clients and
        confirm identities, but it has not been told how to allow or
        restrict access to the clients bearing those identities.  This
        section describes two strategies for controlling access to
        your repositories.</p>
        <div class="sect3" title="Blanket access control">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.blanket"></a>Blanket access control</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The simplest form of access control is to authorize
          certain users for either read-only access to a repository or
          read/write access to a repository.</p>
          <p>You can restrict access on all repository operations by
          adding <code class="literal">Require valid-user</code> directly inside
          the <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block.  The example
          from <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.httpd.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authn.digest" title="Digest authentication">the section called “Digest authentication”</a>
          allows only clients that successfully authenticate to do
          anything with the Subversion repository:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # Authentication: Digest
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthType Digest
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth.htdigest

  # Authorization: Authenticated users only
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Sometimes you don't need to run such a tight ship.  For
          example, Subversion's own source code repository at
          <a class="ulink" href="http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn" target="_top">http://svn.collab.net/repos/svn</a> allows anyone
          in the world to perform read-only repository tasks (such as
          checking out working copies and browsing the repository),
          but restricts write operations to authenticated users.  The
          <code class="literal">Limit</code> and <code class="literal">LimitExcept</code>
          directives allow for this type of selective restriction.
          Like the <code class="literal">Location</code> directive, these blocks
          have starting and ending tags, and you would nest them
          inside your <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code>
          block.</p>
          <p>The parameters present on the <code class="literal">Limit</code>
          and <code class="literal">LimitExcept</code> directives are HTTP
          request types that are affected by that block.  For example,
          to allow anonymous read-only operations, you would use the
          <code class="literal">LimitExcept</code> directive (passing the
          <code class="literal">GET</code>, <code class="literal">PROPFIND</code>,
          <code class="literal">OPTIONS</code>, and <code class="literal">REPORT</code>
          request type parameters) and place the previously mentioned
          <code class="literal">Require valid-user</code> directive inside the
          <code class="literal">&lt;LimitExcept&gt;</code> block instead of just
          inside the <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block.</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth.htdigest

  # Authorization: Authenticated users only for non-read-only
  #                (write) operations; allow anonymous reads
  &lt;LimitExcept GET PROPFIND OPTIONS REPORT&gt;

  &lt;/LimitExcept&gt;
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>

          <p>These are only a few simple examples.  For more in-depth
          information about Apache access control and the
          <code class="literal">Require</code> directive, take a look at the
          <code class="literal">Security</code> section of the Apache
          documentation's tutorials collection at <a class="ulink" href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/misc/tutorials.html" target="_top">http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.0/misc/tutorials.html</a>.</p>

          <p>It's possible to set up finer-grained permissions using
          <span class="command"><strong>mod_authz_svn</strong></span>.  This Apache module grabs
          the various opaque URLs passing from client to server, asks
          <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> to decode them, and then
          possibly vetoes requests based on access policies defined in
          a configuration file.</p>
          <p>If you've built Subversion from source code,
          <span class="command"><strong>mod_authz_svn</strong></span> is automatically built
          and installed alongside <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>.
          Many binary distributions install it automatically as well.
          To verify that it's installed correctly, make sure it comes
          right after <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>'s
          <code class="literal">LoadModule</code> directive in
          <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code>:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
LoadModule dav_module         modules/mod_dav.so

LoadModule authz_svn_module   modules/mod_authz_svn.so
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>To activate this module, you need to configure your
          <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block to use the
          <code class="literal">AuthzSVNAccessFile</code> directive, which
          specifies a file containing the permissions policy for paths
          within your repositories.  (In a moment, we'll discuss the
          format of that file.)</p>
          <p>Apache is flexible, so you have the option to configure
          your block in one of three general patterns.  To begin,
          choose one of these basic configuration patterns.  (The
          following examples are very simple; look at Apache's own
          documentation for much more detail on Apache authentication
          and authorization options.)</p>
          <p>The most open approach is to allow access to everyone.
          This means Apache never sends authentication challenges, and
          all users are treated as <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">anonymous</span>”</span>.  (See
          <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.httpd.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-1" title="Example 6.2. A sample configuration for anonymous access">Example 6.2, “A sample configuration for anonymous access”</a>.)</p>
          <div class="example">
            <a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-1"></a>
            <p class="title">
              <b>Example 6.2. A sample configuration for anonymous access</b>
            </p>
            <div class="example-contents">
              <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # Authentication: None

  # Authorization: Path-based access control
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
            </div>
          </div>
          <br class="example-break" />
          <p>On the opposite end of the paranoia scale, you can
          configure Apache to authenticate all clients.
          This block unconditionally requires authentication via the
          <code class="literal">Require valid-user</code> directive, and defines
          a means to authenticate valid users.  (See
          <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.httpd.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-2" title="Example 6.3. A sample configuration for authenticated access">Example 6.3, “A sample configuration for authenticated access”</a>.)</p>
          <div class="example">
            <a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-2"></a>
            <p class="title">
              <b>Example 6.3. A sample configuration for authenticated access</b>
            </p>
            <div class="example-contents">
              <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /repos&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn

  # Authentication: Digest
  AuthName "Subversion repository"
  AuthType Digest
  AuthUserFile /etc/svn-auth.htdigest

  # Authorization: Path-based access control; authenticated users only
  AuthzSVNAccessFile /path/to/access/file
  Require valid-user
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
            </div>
          </div>
          <br class="example-break" />
          <p>A third very popular pattern is to allow a combination
          of authenticated and anonymous access.  For example, many
          administrators want to allow anonymous users to read certain
          repository directories, but restrict access to more
          sensitive areas to authenticated users.  In this setup, all
          users start out accessing the repository anonymously.  If
          your access control policy demands a real username at any
          point, Apache will demand authentication from the client.
          To do this, use both the <code class="literal">Satisfy Any</code>
          and <code class="literal">Require valid-user</code> directives.  (See
          <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.httpd.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.perdir.ex-3" title="Example 6.4. A sample configuration for mixed authenticated/anonymous access">Example 6.4, “A sample configuration for mixed
            authenticated/anonymous access”</a>.)</p>

            <p class="title">
              <b>Example 6.4. A sample configuration for mixed
            authenticated/anonymous access</b>

          <p>The next step is to create the authorization file
          containing access rules for particular paths within the
          repository.  We describe how later in this chapter, in
          <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.pathbasedauthz.html" title="Path-Based Authorization">the section called “Path-Based Authorization”</a>.</p>

          <p>The <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> module goes through a
          lot of work to make sure that data you've marked
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">unreadable</span>”</span> doesn't get accidentally leaked.
          This means it needs to closely monitor all of the paths
          and file-contents returned by commands such as <span class="command"><strong>svn
          checkout</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>.
          If these commands encounter a path that isn't
          readable according to some authorization policy, the
          path is typically omitted altogether.  In the case of
          history or rename tracing—for example, running a command such
          as <strong class="userinput"><code>svn cat -r OLD foo.c</code></strong> on a file that
          was renamed long ago—the rename tracking will simply
          halt if one of the object's former names is determined to be
          read-restricted.</p>
          <p>All of this path checking can sometimes be quite
          expensive, especially in the case of <span class="command"><strong>svn
          log</strong></span>.  When retrieving a list of revisions, the
          server looks at every changed path in each revision and
          checks it for readability.  If an unreadable path is
          discovered, it's omitted from the list of the revision's
          changed paths (normally seen with
          the <code class="option">--verbose</code> (<code class="option">-v</code>) option),
          and the whole log message is suppressed.  Needless to say,
          this can be time-consuming on revisions that affect a large
          number of files.  This is the cost of security: even if you
          haven't configured a module such as
          <span class="command"><strong>mod_authz_svn</strong></span> at all, the
          <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> module is still asking Apache
          <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span> to run authorization checks on
          every path.  The <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> module has
          no idea what authorization modules have been installed, so
          all it can do is ask Apache to invoke whatever might be
          present.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, there's also an escape hatch of
          sorts, which allows you to trade security features for
          speed.  If you're not enforcing any sort of per-directory
          authorization (i.e., not using
          <span class="command"><strong>mod_authz_svn</strong></span> or similar module),
          you can disable all of this path checking.  In your
          <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> file, use the
          <code class="literal">SVNPathAuthz</code> directive as shown in
          <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.httpd.html#svn.serverconfig.httpd.authz.pathauthzoff.ex-1" title="Example 6.5. Disabling path checks altogether">Example 6.5, “Disabling path checks altogether”</a>.

        <p>Connecting to a repository via <code class="literal">http://</code>
        means that all Subversion activity is sent across the network

        commits, and updates could potentially be intercepted by an
        unauthorized party <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">sniffing</span>”</span> network traffic.
        Encrypting traffic using SSL is a good way to protect
        potentially sensitive information over the network.</p>
        <p>If a Subversion client is compiled to use OpenSSL,
        it gains the ability to speak to an Apache server via
        <code class="literal">https://</code> URLs, so all traffic is encrypted
        with a per-connection session key.  The WebDAV library used by
        the Subversion client is not only able to verify server
        certificates, but can also supply client certificates when
        challenged by the server.</p>

            <p>When the client receives a server certificate, it needs
            to verify that the server is who it claims to be. OpenSSL
            does this by examining the signer of the server certificate,
            or <em class="firstterm">certificate authority</em> (CA).  If
            OpenSSL is unable to automatically trust the CA, or if some
            other problem occurs (such as an expired certificate or
            hostname mismatch), the Subversion command-line client will
            ask you whether you want to trust the server certificate
            anyway:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">

(R)eject, accept (t)emporarily or accept (p)ermanently?
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>This dialogue is essentially the same question you may
            have seen coming from your web browser (which is just
            another HTTP client like Subversion).  If you choose the
            <code class="literal">(p)</code>ermanent option, Subversion will
            cache the server certificate in your private runtime
            <code class="filename">auth/</code> area, just as your username and
            password are cached (see <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.netmodel.html#svn.serverconfig.netmodel.credcache" title="Caching credentials">the section called “Caching credentials”</a>), and will
            automatically trust the certificate in the future.</p>
            <p>Your runtime <code class="filename">servers</code> file also gives
            you the ability to make your Subversion client automatically
            trust specific CAs, either globally or on a per-host basis.
            Simply set the <code class="literal">ssl-authority-files</code>
            variable to a semicolon-separated list of PEM-encoded CA
            certificates:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting">
[global]
ssl-authority-files = /path/to/CAcert1.pem;/path/to/CAcert2.pem
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Many OpenSSL installations also have a predefined set
            of <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">default</span>”</span> CAs that are nearly universally
            trusted.  To make the Subversion client automatically trust
            these standard authorities, set the
            <code class="literal">ssl-trust-default-ca</code> variable to
            <code class="literal">true</code>.</p>
          </div>

                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>If the client receives a challenge for a certificate,
            the server is asking the client to prove its identity.
            The client must send back a certificate signed by a CA
            that the server trusts, along with a <em class="firstterm">challenge
            response</em> which proves that the client owns the
            private key associated with the certificate.  The private
            key and certificate are usually stored in an encrypted
            format on disk, protected by a passphrase.  When Subversion
            receives this challenge, it will ask you for the path to the
            encrypted file and the passphrase that protects it:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="screen">
$ svn list https://host.example.com/repos/project

Authentication realm: https://host.example.com:443
Client certificate filename: /path/to/my/cert.p12
Passphrase for '/path/to/my/cert.p12':  ********
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Notice that the client credentials are stored in a
            <code class="literal">.p12</code> file.  To use a client certificate
            with Subversion, it must be in PKCS#12 format, which is a
            portable standard.  Most web browsers are able to import
            and export certificates in that format.  Another option
            is to use the OpenSSL command-line tools to convert
            existing certificates into PKCS#12.</p>
            <p>The runtime <code class="filename">servers</code> file also
            allows you to automate this challenge on a per-host basis.
            If you set the <code class="literal">ssl-client-cert-file</code>
            and <code class="literal">ssl-client-cert-password</code> variables,
            Subversion can automatically respond to a client
            certificate challenge without prompting you:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting">
[groups]
examplehost = host.example.com

[examplehost]
ssl-client-cert-file = /path/to/my/cert.p12
ssl-client-cert-password = somepassword
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>More security-conscious folk might want to exclude
            <code class="literal">ssl-client-cert-password</code> to avoid
            storing the passphrase in the clear on disk.</p>

        <p>We've covered most of the authentication and authorization
        options for Apache and <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>.  But
        there are a few other nice features that Apache
        provides.</p>
        <div class="sect3" title="Repository browsing">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>One of the most useful benefits of an Apache/WebDAV
          configuration for your Subversion repository is that your
          versioned files and directories are immediately available
          for viewing via a regular web browser.  Since Subversion
          uses URLs to identify versioned resources, those URLs used
          for HTTP-based repository access can be typed directly into
          a web browser.  Your browser will issue an
          HTTP <code class="literal">GET</code> request for that URL; based on
          whether that URL represents a versioned directory or
          file, <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> will respond with a
          directory listing or with file contents.</p>
          <div class="sect4" title="URL syntax">
            <div class="titlepage">
              <div>
                <div>
                  <h5 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.browsing.syntax"></a>URL syntax</h5>
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>If the URLs do not contain any information about which
            version of the resource you wish to
            see, <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> will answer with the
            youngest version.  This functionality has the wonderful
            side effect that you can pass around Subversion URLs to
            your peers as references to documents, and those URLs will
            always point at the latest manifestation of that document.
            Of course, you can even use the URLs as hyperlinks from
            other web sites, too.</p>
            <p>As of Subversion 1.6, <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>
            supports a public URI syntax for examining older revisions
            of both files and directories.  The syntax uses the query
            string portion of the URL to specify either or both of a
            peg revision and operative revision, which Subversion will
            then use to determine which version of the file or
            directory to display to your web browser.  Add the query
            string name/value pair
            <code class="literal">p=<em class="replaceable"><code>PEGREV</code></em></code>,
            where <em class="replaceable"><code>PEGREV</code></em> is a revision
            number, to specify the peg revision you wish to apply to the
            request.  Use
            <code class="literal">r=<em class="replaceable"><code>REV</code></em></code>,
            where <em class="replaceable"><code>REV</code></em> is a revision number, to
            specify an operative revision.</p>
            <p>For example, if you wish to see the latest version of a
            <code class="filename">README.txt</code> file located in your
            project's <code class="filename">/trunk</code>, point your web
            browser to that file's repository URL, which might look
            something like the following:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting">
http://host.example.com/repos/project/trunk/README.txt
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>If you now wish to see some older version of that
            file, add an operative revision to the URL's query
            string:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting">
http://host.example.com/repos/project/trunk/README.txt?r=1234
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>What if the thing you're trying to view no longer exists
            in the youngest revision of the repository?  That's where a
            peg revision is handy:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting">
http://host.example.com/repos/project/trunk/deleted-thing.txt?p=321
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>And of course, you can combine peg revision and
            operative revision specifiers to fine-tune the exact item
            you wish to view:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting">
http://host.example.com/repos/project/trunk/renamed-thing.txt?p=123&amp;r=21
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>The previous URL would display revision 21 of the
            object which, in revision 123, was located
            at <code class="filename">/trunk/renamed-thing.txt</code> in the
            repository.  See <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.pegrevs.html" title="Peg and Operative Revisions">the section called “Peg and Operative Revisions”</a> for a
            detailed explanation of these <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">peg revision</span>”</span>
            and <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">operative revision</span>”</span> concepts.  They can
            be a bit tricky to wrap your head around.</p>
            <p>As a reminder, this feature
            of <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> offers only a limited
            repository browsing experience.  You can see directory
            listings and file contents, but no revision properties
            (such as commit log messages) or file/directory
            properties.  For folks who require more extensive browsing
            of repositories and their history, there are several
            third-party software packages which offer this.  Some
            examples include ViewVC

            built-in <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">browseability</span>”</span>, and generally offer
            a much wider set of features, including the display of the
            aforementioned property sets, display of content
            differences between file revisions, and so on.</p>

            <p>When browsing a Subversion repository, the web browser
            gets a clue about how to render a file's contents by
            looking at the <code class="literal">Content-Type:</code> header
            returned in Apache's response to the
            HTTP <code class="literal">GET</code> request.  The value of this
            header is some sort of MIME type.  By default, Apache will
            tell the web browsers that all repository files are of
            the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">default</span>”</span> MIME type,
            typically <code class="literal">text/plain</code>.  This can be
            frustrating, however, if a user wishes repository files to
            render as something more meaningful—for example,
            it might be nice to have a <code class="filename">foo.html</code> file
            in the repository actually render as HTML when
            browsing.</p>
            <p>To make this happen, you need only to make sure that
            your files have the proper <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code>
            set.  We discuss this in more detail in
            <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="File Content Type">the section called “File Content Type”</a>,
            and you can even configure your client to automatically
            attach proper <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> properties
            to files entering the repository for the first time; see
            <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.html#svn.advanced.props.auto" title="Automatic Property Setting">the section called “Automatic Property Setting”</a>.</p>
            <p>Continuing our example, if one were to set
            the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property
            to <code class="literal">text/html</code> on
            file <code class="filename">foo.html</code>, Apache would properly
            tell your web browser to render the file as HTML.  One
            could also attach proper <code class="literal">image/*</code>
            MIME-type properties to image files and ultimately get an
            entire web site to be viewable directly from a repository!
            There's generally no problem with this, as long as the web
            site doesn't contain any dynamically generated
            content.</p>

            <p>You generally will get more use out of URLs to
            versioned files—after all, that's where the
            interesting content tends to lie.  But you might have
            occasion to browse a Subversion directory listing, where
            you'll quickly note that the generated HTML used to
            display that listing is very basic, and certainly not
            intended to be aesthetically pleasing (or even
            interesting).  To enable customization of these directory
            displays, Subversion provides an XML index feature.  A
            single <code class="literal">SVNIndexXSLT</code> directive in your
            repository's <code class="literal">Location</code> block of
            <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> will
            instruct <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> to generate XML
            output when displaying a directory listing, and to
            reference the XSLT stylesheet of your choice:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNParentPath /var/svn
  SVNIndexXSLT "/svnindex.xsl"
  …
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>Using the <code class="literal">SVNIndexXSLT</code> directive
            and a creative XSLT stylesheet, you can make your
            directory listings match the color schemes and imagery
            used in other parts of your web site.  Or, if you'd
            prefer, you can use the sample stylesheets provided in the
            Subversion source distribution's
            <code class="filename">tools/xslt/</code> directory.
            Keep in mind that the path provided to the
            <code class="literal">SVNIndexXSLT</code> directory is actually a
            URL path—browsers need to be able to read your
            stylesheets to make use of them!</p>

            <p>If you're serving a collection of repositories from a

            directive, then it's also possible to have Apache display
            all available repositories to a web browser.  Just
            activate the <code class="literal">SVNListParentPath</code>
            directive:</p>

            in <code class="filename">/var/svn</code>.  Obviously, this can be

        <div class="sect3" title="Apache logging">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>
              <div>
                <h4 class="title"><a id="svn.serverconfig.httpd.extra.logging"></a>Apache logging</h4>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Because Apache is an HTTP server at heart, it contains
          fantastically flexible logging features.  It's beyond the
          scope of this book to discuss all of the ways logging can be
          configured, but we should point out that even the most
          generic <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> file will cause
          Apache to produce two logs:
          <code class="filename">error_log</code>
          and <code class="filename">access_log</code>.  These logs may appear
          in different places, but are typically created in the
          logging area of your Apache installation.  (On Unix, they
          often live
          in <code class="filename">/usr/local/apache2/logs/</code>.)</p>
          <p>The <code class="filename">error_log</code> describes any internal
          errors that Apache runs into as it works.
          The <code class="filename">access_log</code> file records every
          incoming HTTP request received by Apache.  This makes it
          easy to see, for example, which IP addresses Subversion
          clients are coming from, how often particular clients use
          the server, which users are authenticating properly, and
          which requests succeed or fail.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, because HTTP is a stateless protocol,
          even the simplest Subversion client operation generates
          multiple network requests.  It's very difficult to look at
          the <code class="filename">access_log</code> and deduce what the
          client was doing—most operations look like a series
          of cryptic <code class="literal">PROPPATCH</code>, <code class="literal">GET</code>,
          <code class="literal">PUT</code>, and <code class="literal">REPORT</code>
          requests.  To make things worse, many client operations send
          nearly identical series of requests, so it's even harder to
          tell them apart.</p>
          <p><span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>, however, can come to
          your aid.  By activating an <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">operational
          logging</span>”</span> feature, you can
          ask <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> to create a separate log
          file describing what sort of high-level operations your
          clients are performing.</p>
          <p>To do this, you need to make use of
          Apache's <code class="literal">CustomLog</code> directive (which is
          explained in more detail in Apache's own documentation).
          Be sure to invoke this
          directive <span class="emphasis"><em>outside</em></span> your
          Subversion <code class="literal">Location</code> block:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  …
&lt;/Location&gt;

CustomLog logs/svn_logfile "%t %u %{SVN-ACTION}e" env=SVN-ACTION
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>In this example, we're asking Apache to create a special
          logfile, <code class="filename">svn_logfile</code>, in the standard
          Apache <code class="filename">logs</code> directory.
          The <code class="literal">%t</code> and <code class="literal">%u</code>
          variables are replaced by the time and username of the
          request, respectively.  The really important parts are the
          two instances of <code class="literal">SVN-ACTION</code>.
          When Apache sees that variable, it substitutes the value of
          the <code class="literal">SVN-ACTION</code> environment variable,
          which is automatically set by <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>
          whenever it detects a high-level client action.</p>
          <p>So, instead of having to interpret a
          traditional <code class="filename">access_log</code> like
          this:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">

          and <code class="literal">SVN-REPOS-NAME</code> variables, which carry

          <p>One of the nice advantages of using Apache as a
          Subversion server is that it can be set up for simple
          replication.  For example, suppose that your team is
          distributed across four offices around the globe.  The
          Subversion repository can exist only in one of those
          offices, which means the other three offices will not enjoy
          accessing it—they're likely to experience
          significantly slower traffic and response times when
          updating and committing code.  A powerful solution is to set
          up a system consisting of one <em class="firstterm">master</em>
          Apache server and several <em class="firstterm">slave</em>
          Apache servers.  If you place a slave server in each office,
          users can check out a working copy from whichever slave
          is closest to them.  All read requests go to their local
          slave.  Write requests get automatically routed to the
          single master server.  When the commit completes, the master
          then automatically <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">pushes</span>”</span> the new revision to
          each slave server using the <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span>
          replication tool.</p>
          <p>This configuration creates a huge perceptual speed
          increase for your users, because Subversion client traffic
          is typically 80–90% read requests.  And if those
          requests are coming from a <span class="emphasis"><em>local</em></span>
          server, it's a huge win.</p>
          <p>In this section, we'll walk you through a standard setup
          of this single-master/multiple-slave system.  However, keep
          in mind that your servers must be running at least Apache
          2.2.0 (with <span class="command"><strong>mod_proxy</strong></span> loaded) and
          Subversion 1.5 (<span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span>).</p>
          <div class="sect4" title="Configure the servers">
            <div class="titlepage">
              <div>

                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>First, configure your master server's
            <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> file in the usual way.
            Make the repository available at a certain URI location,
            and configure authentication and authorization however
            you'd like.  After that's done, configure each of your
            <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">slave</span>”</span> servers in the exact same way, but
            add the special <code class="literal">SVNMasterURI</code> directive
            to the block:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="programlisting">
&lt;Location /svn&gt;
  DAV svn
  SVNPath /var/svn/repos
  SVNMasterURI http://master.example.com/svn
  …
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre>
            </div>
            <p>This new directive tells a slave server to redirect
            all write requests to the master.  (This is done
            automatically via Apache's <span class="command"><strong>mod_proxy</strong></span>
            module.)  Ordinary read requests, however, are still
            serviced by the slaves.  Be sure that your master and
            slave servers all have matching authentication and
            authorization configurations;  if they fall out of sync,
            it can lead to big headaches.</p>
            <p>Next, we need to deal with the problem of infinite
            recursion.  With the current configuration, imagine what
            will happen when a Subversion client performs a commit to
            the master server.  After the commit completes, the server
            uses <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> to replicate the new
            revision to each slave.  But because
            <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> appears to be just another
            Subversion client performing a commit, the slave will
            immediately attempt to proxy the incoming write request
            back to the master!  Hilarity ensues.</p>
            <p>The solution to this problem is to have the master
            push revisions to a different
            <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> on the slaves.  This
            location is configured to <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> proxy
            write requests at all, but to accept normal commits from
            (and only from) the master's IP address:</p>

            <p>Now that you've configured
            your <code class="literal">Location</code> blocks on master and
            slaves, you need to configure the master to replicate to
            the slaves.  Our walkthough uses <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span>,
            which is covered in more detail in
            <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.replication.svnsync" title="Replication with svnsync">the section called “Replication with svnsync”</a>.</p>
            <p>First, make sure that each slave repository has a
            <code class="filename">pre-revprop-change</code> hook script which
            allows remote revision property changes.  (This is
            standard procedure for being on the receiving end of
            <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span>.) Then log into the master
            server and configure each of the slave repository URIs to
            receive data from the master repository on the local
            disk:</p>
            <div class="informalexample">
              <pre class="screen">

            <p>After this is done, we configure the master server's
            <code class="literal">post-commit</code> hook script to invoke
            <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> on each slave server:</p>

            commands to run in the background so that the Subversion
            client isn't left waiting forever for the commit to
            finish.  In addition to this
            <code class="literal">post-commit</code> hook, you'll need a
            <code class="literal">post-revprop-change</code> hook as well so
            that when a user, say, modifies a log message, the slave
            servers get that change also:</p>

            </div>
            <p>The only thing we've left out here is what to do about
            user-level locks (of the <span class="command"><strong>svn lock</strong></span>
            variety).  Locks are enforced by the master server during
            commit operations; but all the information about locks is
            distributed during read operations such as <span class="command"><strong>svn
            update</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> by the
            slave server.  As such, a fully functioning proxy setup
            needs to perfectly replicate lock information from the
            master server to the slave servers.  Unfortunately, most
            of the mechanisms that one might employ to accomplish this
            replication fall short in one way or
            another<sup>[<a id="idp39760960" href="#ftn.idp39760960" class="footnote">49</a>]</sup>.  Many teams
            don't use Subversion's locking features at all, so this
            may be a nonissue for you.  Sadly, for those teams which
            do use locks, we have no recommendations on how to
            gracefully work around this shortcoming.</p>

            <p>Your master/slave replication system should now be
            ready to use.  A couple of words of warning are in order,
            however.  Remember that this replication isn't entirely
            robust in the face of computer or network crashes.  For
            example, if one of the automated
            <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> commands fails to complete for
            some reason, the slaves will begin to fall behind.  For
            example, your remote users will see that they've committed
            revision 100, but then when they run <span class="command"><strong>svn
            update</strong></span>, their local server will tell them that
            revision 100 doesn't yet exist!  Of course, the problem
            will be automatically fixed the next time another commit
            happens and the subsequent <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> is
            successful—the sync will replicate all waiting
            revisions.  But still, you may want to set up some sort of
            out-of-band monitoring to notice synchronization failures
            and force <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> to run when things go
            wrong.</p>
            <p>Another limitation of the write-through proxy
            deployment model involves version mismatches—of the
            version of Subversion which is installed, that
            is—between the master and slave servers.  Each new
            release of Subversion may (and often does) add new
            features to the network protocol used between the clients
            and servers.  Since feature negotiation happens against
            the slave, it is the slave's protocol version and feature
            set which is used.  But write operations are passed
            through to the master server quite literally.  Therefore,
            there is always a risk that the slave server will answer a
            feature negotiation request from the client in way that is
            true for the slave, but untrue for the master if the
            master is running an older version of Subversion.  This
            could result in the client trying to use a new feature
            that the master doesn't understand, and failing.  There
            are a couple of known problems of this sort in Subversion
            1.7, which introduced a major revision of its HTTP
            protocol.  If you are deploying a Subversion 1.7 slave
            server in front of a pre-1.7 master, you'll want to
            configure your slave server's
            Subversion <code class="literal">&lt;Location&gt;</code> block with
            the <code class="literal">SVNAdvertiseV2Protocol Off</code>
            directive.</p>

                <b>Can We Set Up Replication with svnserve?</b>
              </p>
              <p>If you're using <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> instead
              of Apache as your server, you can certainly configure
              your repository's hook scripts to invoke
              <span class="command"><strong>svnsync</strong></span> as we've shown here, thereby
              causing automatic replication from master to slaves.
              Unfortunately, at the time of this writing there is no way to
              make slave <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> servers
              automatically proxy write requests back to the master
              server.  This means your users would only be able to
              check out read-only working copies from the slave
              servers.  You'd have to configure your slave servers to
              disallow write access completely.  This might be useful
              for creating read-only <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mirrors</span>”</span> of popular
              open source projects, but it's not a transparent
              proxying system.</p>

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Several of the features already provided by Apache in
          its role as a robust web server can be leveraged for
          increased functionality or security in Subversion as well.
          The Subversion client is able to use SSL (the Secure Sockets
          Layer, discussed earlier).  If your Subversion client is
          built to support SSL, it can access your Apache server
          using <code class="literal">https://</code> and enjoy a high-quality
          encrypted network session.</p>
          <p>Equally useful are other features of the Apache and
          Subversion relationship, such as the ability to specify a
          custom port (instead of the default HTTP port 80) or a
          virtual domain name by which the Subversion repository
          should be accessed, or the ability to access the repository
          through an HTTP proxy.</p>
          <p>Finally, because <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> is
          speaking a subset of the WebDAV/DeltaV protocol, it's
          possible to access the repository via third-party DAV
          clients.  Most modern operating systems (Win32, OS X, and
          Linux) have the built-in ability to mount a DAV server as a
          standard network <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">shared folder.</span>”</span> This is a
          complicated topic, but also wondrous when implemented.  For
          details, read <a class="xref" href="svn.webdav.html" title="Appendix C. WebDAV and Autoversioning">Appendix C, <i>WebDAV and Autoversioning</i></a>.</p>
          <p>Note that there are a number of other small tweaks one can
          make to <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> that are too obscure
          to mention in this chapter.  For a complete list of
          all <code class="filename">httpd.conf</code> directives
          that <span class="command"><strong>mod_dav_svn</strong></span> responds to, see
