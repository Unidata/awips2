      <p>Due largely to the simplicity of the overall design of the
      Subversion repository and the technologies on which it relies,
      creating and configuring a repository are fairly straightforward
      tasks.  There are a few preliminary decisions you'll want to
      make, but the actual work involved in any given setup of a
      Subversion repository is pretty basic, tending toward
      mindless repetition if you find yourself setting up multiples of
      these things.</p>
      <p>Some things you'll want to consider beforehand, though, are:</p>
      <div class="itemizedlist">
        <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>What data do you expect to live in your repository (or
          repositories), and how will that data be organized?</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>Where will your repository live, and how will it be
          accessed?</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>What types of access control and repository event
          reporting do you need?</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>Which of the available types of data store do you want
          to use?</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <p>In this section, we'll try to help you answer those
      questions.</p>
      <div class="sect2" title="Planning Your Repository Organization">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.reposadmin.projects.chooselayout"></a>Planning Your Repository Organization</h3>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>While Subversion allows you to move around versioned files
        and directories without any loss of information, and even
        provides ways of moving whole sets of versioned history from
        one repository to another, doing so can greatly disrupt the
        workflow of those who access the repository often and come to
        expect things to be at certain locations.  So before creating
        a new repository, try to peer into the future a bit; plan
        ahead before placing your data under version control.  By
        conscientiously <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">laying out</span>”</span> your repository or
        repositories and their versioned contents ahead of time, you
        can prevent many future headaches.</p>
        <p>Let's assume that as repository administrator, you will be
        responsible for supporting the version control system for
        several projects.  Your first decision is whether to use a
        single repository for multiple projects, or to give each
        project its own repository, or some compromise of these
        two.</p>
        <p>There are benefits to using a single repository for
        multiple projects, most obviously the lack of duplicated
        maintenance.  A single repository means that there is one set
        of hook programs, one thing to routinely back up, one thing to
        dump and load if Subversion releases an incompatible new
        version, and so on.  Also, you can move data between projects
        easily, without losing any historical versioning
        information.</p>
        <p>The downside of using a single repository is that
        different projects may have different requirements in terms of
        the repository event triggers, such as needing to send commit
        notification emails to different mailing lists, or having
        different definitions about what does and does not constitute
        a legitimate commit.  These aren't insurmountable problems, of
        course—it just means that all of your hook scripts have
        to be sensitive to the layout of your repository rather than
        assuming that the whole repository is associated with a single
        group of people.  Also, remember that Subversion uses
        repository-global revision numbers.  While those numbers don't
        have any particular magical powers, some folks still don't
        like the fact that even though no changes have been made to
        their project lately, the youngest revision number for the
        repository keeps climbing because other projects are actively
        adding new revisions.<sup>[<a id="idp37525568" href="#ftn.idp37525568" class="footnote">31</a>]</sup></p>
        <p>A middle-ground approach can be taken, too.  For example,
        projects can be grouped by how well they relate to each other.
        You might have a few repositories with a handful of projects
        in each repository.  That way, projects that are likely to
        want to share data can do so easily, and as new revisions are
        added to the repository, at least the developers know that
        those new revisions are at least remotely related to everyone
        who uses that repository.</p>
        <p>
        <a id="idp37492944" class="indexterm"></a>

        After deciding how to organize your projects with respect
        to repositories, you'll probably want to think about directory
        hierarchies within the repositories themselves.  Because
        Subversion uses regular directory copies for branching and
        tagging (see <a class="xref" href="svn.branchmerge.html" title="Chapter 4. Branching and Merging">Chapter 4, <i>Branching and Merging</i></a>), the
        Subversion community recommends that you choose a repository
        location for each project
        root—the <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">topmost</span>”</span> directory
        that contains data related to that project—and then
        create three subdirectories beneath that root:
        <code class="filename">trunk</code>, meaning the directory under which
        the main project development occurs;
        <code class="filename">branches</code>, which is a directory in which
        to create various named branches of the main development line;
        and <code class="filename">tags</code>, which is a collection of tree
        snapshots that are created, and perhaps destroyed, but never
        changed.<sup>[<a id="idp37498032" href="#ftn.idp37498032" class="footnote">32</a>]</sup></p>
        <p>For example, your repository might look like this:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
/
   calc/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   calendar/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   spreadsheet/
      trunk/
      tags/
      branches/
   …
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Note that it doesn't matter where in your repository each
        project root is.  If you have only one project per repository,
        the logical place to put each project root is at the root of
        that project's respective repository.  If you have multiple
        projects, you might want to arrange them in groups inside the
        repository, perhaps putting projects with similar goals or
        shared code in the same subdirectory, or maybe just grouping
        them alphabetically.  Such an arrangement might look
        like this:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
/
   utils/
      calc/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      calendar/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      …
   office/
      spreadsheet/
         trunk/
         tags/
         branches/
      …
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Lay out your repository in whatever way you see fit.
        Subversion does not expect or enforce a particular layout—in
        its eyes, a directory is a directory is a directory.
        Ultimately, you should choose the repository arrangement that
        meets the needs of the people who work on the projects that
        live there.</p>
        <p>In the name of full disclosure, though, we'll mention
        another very common layout.  In this layout, the
        <code class="filename">trunk</code>, <code class="filename">tags</code>, and
        <code class="filename">branches</code> directories live in the root
        directory of your repository, and your projects are in
        subdirectories beneath those, like so:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
/
   trunk/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      …
   tags/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      …
   branches/
      calc/
      calendar/
      spreadsheet/
      …
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>There's nothing particularly incorrect about such a
        layout, but it may or may not seem as intuitive for your
        users.  Especially in large, multiproject situations with
        many users, those users may tend to be familiar with only one
        or two of the projects in the repository.  But the
        projects-as-branch-siblings approach tends to deemphasize project
        individuality and focus on the entire set of projects as a
        single entity.  That's a social issue, though.  We like our
        originally suggested arrangement for purely practical
        reasons—it's easier to ask about (or modify, or migrate
        elsewhere) the entire history of a single project when there's
        a single repository path that holds the entire
        history—past, present, tagged, and branched—for
        that project and that project alone.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Before creating your Subversion repository, an obvious
        question you'll need to answer is where the thing is going to
        live.  This is strongly connected to myriad other
        questions involving how the repository will be accessed (via a
        Subversion server or directly), by whom (users behind your
        corporate firewall or the whole world out on the open
        Internet), what other services you'll be providing around
        Subversion (repository browsing interfaces, email-based
        commit notification, etc.), your data backup strategy, and so
        on.</p>
        <p>We cover server choice and configuration in <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.html" title="Chapter 6. Server Configuration">Chapter 6, <i>Server Configuration</i></a>, but the point we'd like to
        briefly make here is simply that the answers to some of these
        other questions might have implications that force your hand
        when deciding where your repository will live.  For example,
        certain deployment scenarios might require accessing the
        repository via a remote filesystem from multiple computers, in
        which case (as you'll read in the next section) your choice of
        a repository backend data store turns out not to be a choice
        at all because only one of the available backends will work
        in this scenario.</p>
        <p>Addressing each possible way to deploy
        Subversion is both impossible and outside the scope of this
        book.  We simply encourage you to evaluate your options using
        these pages and other sources as your reference material and to
        plan ahead.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Subversion provides two options for the
        type of underlying data store—often referred to as
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the backend</span>”</span> or, somewhat confusingly,
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">the (versioned) filesystem</span>”</span>—that each
        repository uses.  One type of data store keeps everything in a
        Berkeley DB (or BDB) database environment; repositories that
        use this type are often referred to as being
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">BDB-backed.</span>”</span> The other type stores data in
        ordinary flat files, using a custom format.  Subversion
        developers have adopted the habit of referring to this latter
        data storage mechanism
        as <em class="firstterm">FSFS</em><sup>[<a id="idp37577968" href="#ftn.idp37577968" class="footnote">33</a>]</sup>—a
        versioned filesystem implementation that uses the native OS
        filesystem directly—rather than via a database library
        or some other abstraction layer—to store data.</p>

        reliable enough to trust with your versioned data.  But as you
        can see in <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.planning.html#svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.tbl-1" title="Table 5.1. Repository data store comparison">Table 5.1, “Repository data store comparison”</a>, the FSFS
        backend provides quite a bit more flexibility in terms of its
        supported deployment scenarios.  More flexibility means you
        have to work a little harder to find ways to deploy it
        incorrectly.  Those reasons—plus the fact that not using
        Berkeley DB means there's one fewer component in the
        system—largely explain why today almost everyone uses
        the FSFS backend when creating new repositories.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, most programs that access Subversion
        repositories are blissfully ignorant of which backend data
        store is in use.  And you aren't even necessarily stuck with
        your first choice of a data store—in the event that you
        change your mind later, Subversion provides ways of migrating
        your repository's data into another repository that uses a
        different backend data store.  We talk more about that later
        in this chapter.</p>
        <p>The following subsections provide a more detailed look at
        the available backend data store types.</p>
        <div class="sect3" title="Berkeley DB">
          <div class="titlepage">

              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>When the initial design phase of Subversion was in
          progress, the developers decided to use Berkeley DB for a
          variety of reasons, including its open source license,
          transaction support, reliability, performance, API
          simplicity, thread safety, support for cursors, and so
          on.</p>
          <p>Berkeley DB provides real transaction
          support—perhaps its most powerful feature.  Multiple
          processes accessing your Subversion repositories don't have
          to worry about accidentally clobbering each other's data.
          The isolation provided by the transaction system is such
          that for any given operation, the Subversion repository code
          sees a static view of the database—not a database that
          is constantly changing at the hand of some other
          process—and can make decisions based on that view.  If
          the decision made happens to conflict with what another
          process is doing, the entire operation is rolled back as though
          it never happened, and Subversion gracefully retries the
          operation against a new, updated (and yet still static) view
          of the database.</p>
          <p>Another great feature of Berkeley DB is <em class="firstterm">hot
          backups</em>—the ability to back up the
          database environment without taking it
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">offline.</span>”</span> We'll discuss how to back up your
          repository later in this chapter (in <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.backup" title="Repository Backup">the section called “Repository Backup”</a>), but the benefits
          of being able to make fully functional copies of your
          repositories without any downtime should be obvious.</p>
          <p>Berkeley DB is also a very reliable database system when
          properly used.  Subversion uses Berkeley DB's logging
          facilities, which means that the database first writes to
          on-disk logfiles a description of any modifications it is
          about to make, and then makes the modification itself.  This
          is to ensure that if anything goes wrong, the database
          system can back up to a previous
          <em class="firstterm">checkpoint</em>—a location in the
          logfiles known not to be corrupt—and replay
          transactions until the data is restored to a usable state.
          See <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace" title="Managing Disk Space">the section called “Managing Disk Space”</a> later
          in this chapter for more about Berkeley DB logfiles.</p>
          <p>But every rose has its thorn, and so we must note some
          known limitations of Berkeley DB.  First, Berkeley DB
          environments are not portable.  You cannot simply copy a
          Subversion repository that was created on a Unix system onto
          a Windows system and expect it to work.  While much of the
          Berkeley DB database format is architecture-independent,
          other aspects of the environment are not.
          Second, Subversion uses Berkeley DB in a way that will not
          operate on Windows 95/98 systems—if you need to house
          a BDB-backed repository on a Windows machine, stick with
          Windows 2000 or later.</p>
          <p>While Berkeley DB promises to behave correctly on
          network shares that meet a particular set of
          specifications,<sup>[<a id="idp37619904" href="#ftn.idp37619904" class="footnote">34</a>]</sup> most
          networked filesystem types and appliances do
          <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> actually meet those requirements.
          And in no case can you allow a BDB-backed repository that
          resides on a network share to be accessed by multiple
          clients of that share at once (which quite often is the
          whole point of having the repository live on a network share
          in the first place).</p>
          <div class="warning" title="Warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
            <table border="0" summary="Warning">
              <tr>
                <td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25">
                  <img alt="[Warning]" src="images/warning.png" />
                </td>
                <th align="left">Warning</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td align="left" valign="top">
                  <p>If you attempt to use Berkeley DB on a noncompliant
            remote filesystem, the results are unpredictable—you
            may see mysterious errors right away, or it may be months
            before you discover that your repository database is
            subtly corrupted.  You should strongly consider using the
            FSFS data store for repositories that need to live on a
            network share.</p>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>
          <p>Finally, because Berkeley DB is a library linked
          directly into Subversion, it's more sensitive to
          interruptions than a typical relational database system.
          Most SQL systems, for example, have a dedicated server
          process that mediates all access to tables.  If a program
          accessing the database crashes for some reason, the database
          daemon notices the lost connection and cleans up any mess
          left behind.  And because the database daemon is the only
          process accessing the tables, applications don't need to
          worry about permission conflicts.  These things are not the
          case with Berkeley DB, however.  Subversion (and programs
          using Subversion libraries) access the database tables
          directly, which means that a program crash can leave the
          database in a temporarily inconsistent, inaccessible state.
          When this happens, an administrator needs to ask Berkeley DB
          to restore to a checkpoint, which is a bit of an annoyance.
          Other things can cause a repository to <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">wedge</span>”</span>
          besides crashed processes, such as programs conflicting over
          ownership and permissions on the database files.</p>
          <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
            <table border="0" summary="Note">
              <tr>
                <td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25">
                  <img alt="[Note]" src="images/note.png" />
                </td>
                <th align="left">Note</th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td align="left" valign="top">
                  <p>Berkeley DB 4.4 brings (to Subversion 1.4 and later)
            the ability for Subversion to automatically and
            transparently recover Berkeley DB environments in need of
            such recovery.  When a Subversion process attaches to a
            repository's Berkeley DB environment, it uses some process
            accounting mechanisms to detect any unclean disconnections
            by previous processes, performs any necessary recovery,
            and then continues on as though nothing happened.  This
            doesn't completely eliminate instances of repository
            wedging, but it does drastically reduce the amount of
            human interaction required to recover from them.</p>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>
          <p>So while a Berkeley DB repository is quite fast and
          scalable, it's best used by a single server process running
          as one user—such as Apache's <span class="command"><strong>httpd</strong></span>
          or <span class="command"><strong>svnserve</strong></span> (see <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.html" title="Chapter 6. Server Configuration">Chapter 6, <i>Server Configuration</i></a>)—rather than accessing it
          as many different users via <code class="literal">file://</code> or
          <code class="literal">svn+ssh://</code> URLs.  If you're accessing a Berkeley
          DB repository directly as multiple users, be sure to read
          <a class="xref" href="svn.serverconfig.multimethod.html" title="Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods">the section called “Supporting Multiple Repository Access Methods”</a> later in this
          chapter.</p>

        <div class="sect3" title="FSFS">
          <div class="titlepage">
            <div>

          </div>
          <p>In mid-2004, a second type of repository storage
          system—one that doesn't use a database at
          all—came into being.  An FSFS repository stores the
          changes associated with a revision in a single file, and so
          all of a repository's revisions can be found in a single
          subdirectory full of numbered files.  Transactions are
          created in separate subdirectories as individual files.
          When complete, the transaction file is renamed and moved
          into the revisions directory, thus guaranteeing that commits
          are atomic.  And because a revision file is permanent and
          unchanging, the repository also can be backed up while
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">hot,</span>”</span> just like a BDB-backed
          repository.</p>
          <div class="sidebar" title="Revision files and shards">
            <a id="svn.reposadmin.basics.backends.fsfs.revfiles"></a>
            <p class="title">
              <b>Revision files and shards</b>
            </p>
            <p>FSFS repositories contain files that describe the
            changes made in a single revision, and files that contain
            the revision properties associated with a single revision.
            Repositories created in versions of Subversion prior to
            1.5 keep these files in two directories—one for each
            type of file.  As new revisions are committed to the
            repository, Subversion drops more files into these two
            directories—over time, the number of these files in
            each directory can grow to be quite large.  This has been
            observed to cause performance problems on certain
            network-based filesystems.</p>
            <p>Subversion 1.5 creates FSFS-backed repositories using
            a slightly modified layout in which the contents of these
            two directories are <em class="firstterm">sharded</em>, or
            scattered across several subdirectories.  This can greatly
            reduce the time it takes the system to locate any one of
            these files, and therefore increases the overall
            performance of Subversion when reading from the
            repository.</p>
            <p>Subversion 1.6 takes the sharded layout one step
            further, allowing administrators to
            optionally <em class="firstterm">pack</em> each of their
            repository shards up into a single multi-revision file.
            This can have both performance and disk usage benefits.
            See
            <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.diskspace.fsfspacking" title="Packing FSFS filesystems">the section called “Packing FSFS filesystems”</a>
            for more information.</p>
          </div>
          <p>The FSFS revision files describe a revision's
          directory structure, file contents, and deltas against files
          in other revision trees.  Unlike a Berkeley DB database,
          this storage format is portable across different operating
          systems and isn't sensitive to CPU architecture.  Because
          no journaling or shared-memory files are being used, the
          repository can be safely accessed over a network filesystem
          and examined in a read-only environment.  The lack of
          database overhead also means the overall repository
          size is a bit smaller.</p>
          <p>FSFS has different performance characteristics, too.
          When committing a directory with a huge number of files,
          FSFS is able to more quickly append directory entries.  On
          the other hand, FSFS has a longer delay when finalizing a
          commit while it performs tasks that the BDB backend
          amortizes across the lifetime of the commit, which could in
          extreme cases cause clients to time out while waiting for a
          response.</p>
          <p>The most important distinction, however, is FSFS's
          imperviousness to wedging when something goes wrong.  If a
          process using a Berkeley DB database runs into a permissions
          problem or suddenly crashes, the database can be left in an
          unusable state until an administrator recovers it.  If the
          same scenarios happen to a process using an FSFS repository,
          the repository isn't affected at all.  At worst, some
          transaction data is left behind.</p>
