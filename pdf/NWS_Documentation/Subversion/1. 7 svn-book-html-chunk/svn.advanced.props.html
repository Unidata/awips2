      <p>We've already covered in detail how Subversion stores and
      retrieves various versions of files and directories in its
      repository.  Whole chapters have been devoted to this most
      fundamental piece of functionality provided by the tool.  And
      if the versioning support stopped there, Subversion would still
      be complete from a version control perspective.</p>
      <p>But it doesn't stop there.</p>
      <p>In addition to versioning your directories and files,
      Subversion provides interfaces for adding, modifying, and
      removing versioned metadata on each of your versioned
      directories and files.  We refer to this metadata as
      <em class="firstterm">properties</em>, and they can be thought of as
      two-column tables that map property names to arbitrary values
      attached to each item in your working copy.  Generally speaking,
      the names and values of the properties can be whatever you want
      them to be, with the constraint that the names must contain only
      ASCII characters.  And the best part about these properties is
      that they, too, are versioned, just like the textual contents of
      your files.  You can modify, commit, and revert property changes
      as easily as you can file content changes.  And the sending and
      receiving of property changes occurs as part of your typical
      commit and update operations—you don't have to change your
      basic processes to accommodate them.</p>

              <p>Subversion has reserved the set of properties whose names
        begin with <code class="literal">svn:</code> as its own.  While there
        are only a handful of such properties in use today, you should
        avoid creating custom properties for your own needs whose names
        begin with this prefix.  Otherwise, you run the risk that a
        future release of Subversion will grow support for a feature
        or behavior driven by a property of the same name but with
        perhaps an entirely different interpretation.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
      </div>
      <p>Properties show up elsewhere in Subversion, too.  Just as
      files and directories may have arbitrary property names and
      values attached to them, each revision as a whole may have
      arbitrary properties attached to it.  The same constraints
      apply—human-readable names and anything-you-want binary
      values.  The main difference is that revision properties are not
      versioned.  In other words, if you change the value of, or
      delete, a revision property, there's no way, within the scope of
      Subversion's functionality, to recover the previous value.</p>
      <p>Subversion has no particular policy regarding the use of
      properties.  It asks only that you do not use property names that
      begin with the prefix <code class="literal">svn:</code>.  That's the
      namespace that it sets aside for its own use.  And Subversion
      does, in fact, use properties—both the versioned and
      unversioned variety.  Certain versioned properties have special
      meaning or effects when found on files and directories, or they
      house a particular bit of information about the revisions on
      which they are found.  Certain revision properties are
      automatically attached to revisions by Subversion's commit
      process, and they carry information about the revision.  Most of
      these properties are mentioned elsewhere in this or other
      chapters as part of the more general topics to which they are
      related.  For an exhaustive list of Subversion's predefined
      properties, see <a class="xref" href="svn.ref.properties.html" title="Subversion Properties">the section called “Subversion Properties”</a>.</p>

        repository hooks) without damaging Subversion's ability to
        function.  So, when writing scripts which operate on your
        Subversion repository data, do not make the mistake of

      <p>In this section, we will examine the utility—both to
      users of Subversion and to Subversion itself—of property
      support.  You'll learn about the property-related
      <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> subcommands and how property
      modifications affect your normal Subversion workflow.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Just as Subversion uses properties to store extra
        information about the files, directories, and revisions that
        it contains, you might also find properties to be of similar
        use.  You might find it useful to have a place
        close to your versioned data to hang custom metadata about
        that data.</p>
        <p>Say you wish to design a web site that houses many digital
        photos and displays them with captions and a datestamp.  Now,
        your set of photos is constantly changing, so you'd like to
        have as much of this site automated as possible.  These photos
        can be quite large, so as is common with sites of this nature,
        you want to provide smaller thumbnail images to your site
        visitors.</p>
        <p>Now, you can get this functionality using traditional
        files.  That is, you can have your
        <code class="filename">image123.jpg</code> and an
        <code class="filename">image123-thumbnail.jpg</code> side by side in a
        directory.  Or if you want to keep the filenames the same, you
        might have your thumbnails in a different directory, such as
        <code class="filename">thumbnails/image123.jpg</code>.  You can also
        store your captions and datestamps in a similar fashion, again
        separated from the original image file.  But the problem here
        is that your collection of files multiplies with each new
        photo added to the site.</p>
        <p>Now consider the same web site deployed in a way that
        makes use of Subversion's file properties.  Imagine having a
        single image file, <code class="filename">image123.jpg</code>, with
        properties set on that file that are named
        <code class="literal">caption</code>, <code class="literal">datestamp</code>, and
        even <code class="literal">thumbnail</code>.  Now your working copy
        directory looks much more manageable—in fact, it looks
        to the casual browser like there are nothing but image files
        in it.  But your automation scripts know better.  They know
        that they can use <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> (or better yet, they
        can use the Subversion language bindings—see <a class="xref" href="svn.developer.usingapi.html" title="Using the APIs">the section called “Using the APIs”</a>) to dig out the extra
        information that your site needs to display without having to
        read an index file or play path manipulation games.</p>
        <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
          <table border="0" summary="Note">
            <tr>
              <td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25">

                <p>While Subversion places few restrictions on the names
          and values you use for properties, it has not been designed
          to optimally carry large property values or large sets of
          properties on a given file or directory.  Subversion
          commonly holds all the property names and values associated
          with a single item in memory at the same time, which can
          cause detrimental performance or failed operations when
          extremely large property sets are used.</p>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>Custom revision properties are also frequently used.  One
        common such use is a property whose value contains an issue
        tracker ID with which the revision is associated, perhaps
        because the change made in that revision fixes a bug filed in
        the tracker issue with that ID.  Other uses include hanging
        more friendly names on the revision—it might be hard to
        remember that revision 1935 was a fully tested revision.  But
        if there's, say, a <code class="literal">test-results</code> property on
        that revision with the value <code class="literal">all passing</code>,
        that's meaningful information to have.  And Subversion allow
        you to easily do this via the <code class="option">--with-revprop</code>
        option of the <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span> command:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">

            <b>Searchability (or, Why <span class="emphasis"><em>Not</em></span>
          Properties)</b>
          </p>
          <p>For all their utility, Subversion properties—or,
          more accurately, the available interfaces to them—have
          a major shortcoming: while it is a simple matter to
          <span class="emphasis"><em>set</em></span> a custom property,
          <span class="emphasis"><em>finding</em></span> that property later is a whole
          different ball of wax.</p>
          <p>Trying to locate a custom revision property generally
          involves performing a linear walk across all the revisions
          of the repository, asking of each revision, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Do you
          have the property I'm looking for?</span>”</span>  Use
          the <code class="option">--with-all-revprops</code> option with
          the <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span> command's XML output mode to
          facilitate this search.  Notice the presence of the custom
          revision property <code class="literal">testresults</code> in the
          following output:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">
            <pre class="screen">
$ svn log --with-all-revprops --xml lib/crit_bits.c
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;log&gt;
&lt;logentry
   revision="912"&gt;
&lt;author&gt;harry&lt;/author&gt;
&lt;date&gt;2011-07-29T14:47:41.169894Z&lt;/date&gt;
&lt;msg&gt;Fix up the last remaining known regression bug.&lt;/msg&gt;
&lt;revprops&gt;
&lt;property
   name="testresults"&gt;all passing&lt;/property&gt;
&lt;/revprops&gt;
&lt;/logentry&gt;
…
$
</pre>
          </div>
          <p>Trying to find a custom versioned property is painful,
          too, and often involves a recursive <span class="command"><strong>svn
          propget</strong></span> across an entire working copy.  In your
          situation, that might not be as bad as a linear walk across
          all revisions.  But it certainly leaves much to be desired
          in terms of both performance and likelihood of success,
          especially if the scope of your search would require a
          working copy from the root of your repository.</p>
          <p>For this reason, you might choose—especially in
          the revision property use case—to simply add your
          metadata to the revision's log message using some
          policy-driven (and perhaps programmatically enforced)
          formatting that is designed to be quickly parsed from the
          output of <span class="command"><strong>svn log</strong></span>.  It is quite common to
          see the following in Subversion log messages:</p>
          <div class="informalexample">

          </div>
          <p>But here again lies some misfortune.  Subversion doesn't
          yet provide a log message templating mechanism, which would
          go a long way toward helping users be consistent with the
          formatting of their log-embedded revision metadata.</p>

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program affords a few ways to
        add or modify file and directory properties.  For properties
        with short, human-readable values, perhaps the simplest way to
        add a new property is to specify the property name and value
        on the command line of the <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span>
        subcommand:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn propset copyright '(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software' calc/button.c
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/button.c'
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>But we've been touting the flexibility that Subversion
        offers for your property values.  And if you are planning to
        have a multiline textual, or even binary, property value, you
        probably do not want to supply that value on the command line.
        So the <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span> subcommand takes a
        <code class="option">--file</code> (<code class="option">-F</code>) option for
        specifying the name of a file that contains the new property
        value.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn propset license -F /path/to/LICENSE calc/button.c
property 'license' set on 'calc/button.c'
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>There are some restrictions on the names you can use for
        properties.  A property name must start with a letter, a colon
        (<code class="literal">:</code>), or an underscore
        (<code class="literal">_</code>); after that, you can also use digits,
        hyphens (<code class="literal">-</code>), and periods
        (<code class="literal">.</code>).<sup>[<a id="idp34120848" href="#ftn.idp34120848" class="footnote">11</a>]</sup></p>
        <p>In addition to the <span class="command"><strong>propset</strong></span> command, the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program supplies the
        <span class="command"><strong>propedit</strong></span> command.  This command uses the
        configured editor program (see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.confarea.html#svn.advanced.confarea.opts.config" title="Config">the section called “Config”</a>) to add or
        modify properties.  When you run the command,
        <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> invokes your editor program on a
        temporary file that contains the current value of the property
        (or that is empty, if you are adding a new property).  Then,
        you just modify that value in your editor program until it
        represents the new value you wish to store for the property,
        save the temporary file, and then exit the editor program.  If
        Subversion detects that you've actually changed the existing
        value of the property, it will accept that as the new property
        value.  If you exit your editor without making any changes, no
        property modification will occur:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn propedit copyright calc/button.c  ### exit the editor without changes
No changes to property 'copyright' on 'calc/button.c'
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>We should note that, as with other <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
        subcommands, those related to properties can act on multiple
        paths at once.  This enables you to modify properties on whole
        sets of files with a single command.  For example, we could
        have done the following:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn propset copyright '(c) 2006 Red-Bean Software' calc/*
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/Makefile'
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/button.c'
property 'copyright' set on 'calc/integer.c'
…
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>All of this property adding and editing isn't really very
        useful if you can't easily get the stored property value.  So
        the <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> program supplies two subcommands
        for displaying the names and values of properties stored on
        files and directories.  The <span class="command"><strong>svn proplist</strong></span>
        command will list the names of properties that exist on a
        path.  Once you know the names of the properties on the node,
        you can request their values individually using <span class="command"><strong>svn
        propget</strong></span>.  This command will, given a property name
        and a path (or set of paths), print the value of the property
        to the standard output stream.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">

        <p>The last property-related subcommand is
        <span class="command"><strong>propdel</strong></span>.  Since Subversion allows you to
        store properties with empty values, you can't remove a
        property altogether using <span class="command"><strong>svn propedit</strong></span> or
        <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span>.  For example, this command will
        <span class="emphasis"><em>not</em></span> yield the desired effect:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">

        <p>You need to use the <span class="command"><strong>propdel</strong></span> subcommand
        to delete properties altogether.  The syntax is similar to the
        other property commands:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">

        <p>Remember those unversioned revision properties?  You can
        modify those, too, using the same <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span>
        subcommands that we just described.  Simply add the
        <code class="option">--revprop</code> command-line parameter and specify
        the revision whose property you wish to modify.  Since
        revisions are global, you don't need to specify a target path
        to these property-related commands so long as you are
        positioned in a working copy of the repository whose revision
        property you wish to modify.  Otherwise, you can simply
        provide the URL of any path in the repository of interest
        (including the repository's root URL).  For example, you might
        want to replace the commit log message of an existing
        revision.<sup>[<a id="idp34147504" href="#ftn.idp34147504" class="footnote">12</a>]</sup>  If
        your current working directory is part of a working copy of
        your repository, you can simply run the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn propset</strong></span> command with no target path:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn propset svn:log "* button.c: Fix a compiler warning." -r11 --revprop
property 'svn:log' set on repository revision '11'
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>But even if you haven't checked out a working copy from
        that repository, you can still effect the property change by
        providing the repository's root URL:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn propset svn:log "* button.c: Fix a compiler warning." -r11 --revprop \
              http://svn.example.com/repos/project
property 'svn:log' set on repository revision '11'
$
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Note that the ability to modify these unversioned
        properties must be explicitly added by the repository
        administrator (see <a class="xref" href="svn.reposadmin.maint.html#svn.reposadmin.maint.setlog" title="Commit Log Message Correction">the section called “Commit Log Message Correction”</a>).
        That's because the properties aren't versioned, so you run the risk of
        losing information if you aren't careful with your edits.
        The repository administrator can set up methods to protect
        against this loss, and by default, modification of
        unversioned properties is disabled.</p>

        </div>
        <p>Now that you are familiar with all of the
        property-related <span class="command"><strong>svn</strong></span> subcommands, let's see
        how property modifications affect the usual Subversion
        workflow.  As we mentioned earlier, file and directory
        properties are versioned, just like your file contents.  As a
        result, Subversion provides the same opportunities for
        merging—cleanly or with conflicts—someone
        else's modifications into your own.</p>
        <p>As with file contents, your property changes are local
        modifications, made permanent only when you commit them to the
        repository with <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>.  Your property
        changes can be easily unmade, too—the <span class="command"><strong>svn
        revert</strong></span> command will restore your files and
        directories to their unedited states—contents, properties,
        and all.  Also, you can receive interesting information about
        the state of your file and directory properties by using the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>
        commands.</p>
        <div class="informalexample">

        <code class="filename">calc/button.c</code>, but not its textual
        contents.  Had we changed both, we would have seen
        <code class="literal">M</code> in the first column, too.  (We cover
        <span class="command"><strong>svn status</strong></span> in <a class="xref" href="svn.tour.cycle.html#svn.tour.cycle.examine.status" title="See an overview of your changes">the section called “See an overview of your changes”</a>).</p>

          <p>As with file contents, local property modifications can
          conflict with changes committed by someone else.  If you
          update your working copy directory and receive property
          changes on a versioned object that clash with your own,
          Subversion will report that the object is in a conflicted
          state.</p>

          details of the conflict.  You should examine the contents of
          this file so you can decide how to resolve the conflict.
          Until the conflict is resolved, you will see a
          <code class="literal">C</code> in the second column of <span class="command"><strong>svn
          status</strong></span> output for that object, and attempts to

          <p>To resolve property conflicts, simply ensure that the
          conflicting properties contain the values that they should,
          and then use the <span class="command"><strong>svn resolved</strong></span> command to
          alert Subversion that you have manually resolved the
          problem.</p>
        </div>
        <p>You might also have noticed the nonstandard way that
        Subversion currently displays property differences.  You can
        still use <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span> and redirect its output
        to create a usable patch file.  The <span class="command"><strong>patch</strong></span>
        program will ignore property patches—as a rule, it
        ignores any noise it can't understand.  This does,
        unfortunately, mean that to fully apply a patch generated by
        <span class="command"><strong>svn diff</strong></span>, any property modifications will
        need to be applied by hand.</p>

            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Properties are a powerful feature of Subversion, acting as
        key components of many Subversion features discussed elsewhere
        in this and other chapters—textual diff and merge
        support, keyword substitution, newline translation, and so on.  But
        to get the full benefit of properties, they must be set on the
        right files and directories.  Unfortunately, that
        step can be easily forgotten in the routine of things, especially
        since failing to set a property doesn't usually result in an
        obvious error (at least compared to, say, failing to
        add a file to version control).  To help your properties get
        applied to the places that need them, Subversion provides a
        couple of simple but useful features.</p>
        <p>Whenever you introduce a file to version control using the
        <span class="command"><strong>svn add</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>svn import</strong></span>
        commands, Subversion tries to assist by setting some common
        file properties automatically.  First, on operating systems
        whose filesystems support an execute permission bit,
        Subversion will automatically set the
        <code class="literal">svn:executable</code> property on newly added or
        imported files whose execute bit is enabled.  (See <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.executable" title="File Executability">the section called “File Executability”</a> later in
        this chapter for more about this property.)</p>
        <p>Second, Subversion tries to determine the file's MIME
        type.  If you've configured a
        <code class="literal">mime-types-files</code> runtime configuration
        parameter, Subversion will try to find a MIME type mapping in
        that file for your file's extension.  If it finds such a
        mapping, it will set your file's
        <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property to the MIME type it
        found.  If no mapping file is configured, or no mapping for
        your file's extension could be found, Subversion will fall
        back to heuristic algorithms to determine the file's MIME
        type.  Depending on how it is built, Subversion 1.7 can make
        use of file scanning libraries<sup>[<a id="idp34190912" href="#ftn.idp34190912" class="footnote">13</a>]</sup> to detect a file's type based on its
        content.  Failing all else, Subversion will employ its own
        very basic heuristic to determine whether the file contains
        nontextual content.  If so, it automatically sets the
        <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property on that file to
        <code class="literal">application/octet-stream</code> (the generic
        <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">this is a collection of bytes</span>”</span> MIME type).  Of
        course, if Subversion guesses incorrectly, or if you wish to
        set the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property to something
        more precise—perhaps <code class="literal">image/png</code> or
        <code class="literal">application/x-shockwave-flash</code>—you can
        always remove or edit that property.  (For more on
        Subversion's use of MIME types, see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.props.file-portability.html#svn.advanced.props.special.mime-type" title="File Content Type">the section called “File Content Type”</a> later in
        this chapter.)</p>
        <div class="note" title="Note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">

                <p>UTF-16 is commonly used to encode files whose semantic
          content is textual in nature, but the encoding itself makes
          heavy use of bytes which our outside the typical ASCII
          character byte range.  As such, Subversion will tend to
          classify such files as binary files, much to the chagrin of
          users who desire line-based differencing and merging,
          keyword substitution, and other behaviors for those
          files.</p>
              </td>
            </tr>
          </table>
        </div>
        <p>Subversion also provides, via its runtime configuration
        system (see <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.confarea.html" title="Runtime Configuration Area">the section called “Runtime Configuration Area”</a>), a more
        flexible automatic property setting feature that allows you
        to create mappings of filename patterns to property names and
        values.  Once again, these mappings affect adds and imports,
        and can not only override the default MIME type decision made
        by Subversion during those operations, but can also set
        additional Subversion or custom properties, too.  For example,
        you might create a mapping that says that anytime you add
        JPEG files—ones whose names match the pattern
        <code class="literal">*.jpg</code>—Subversion should automatically
        set the <code class="literal">svn:mime-type</code> property on those
        files to <code class="literal">image/jpeg</code>.  Or perhaps any files
        that match <code class="literal">*.cpp</code> should have
        <code class="literal">svn:eol-style</code> set to
        <code class="literal">native</code>, and <code class="literal">svn:keywords</code>
        set to <code class="literal">Id</code>.  Automatic property support is
        perhaps the handiest property-related tool in the Subversion
        toolbox.  See <a class="xref" href="svn.advanced.confarea.html#svn.advanced.confarea.opts.config" title="Config">the section called “Config”</a> for more about
        configuring that support.</p>

                <p>Subversion administrators commonly ask if it is possible
          to configure, on the server side, a set of property
          definitions which all connecting clients will automatically
          consider when operating on working copies checked out from
          that server.  Unfortunately, Subversion doesn't offer this
          feature.  Administrators can use hook scripts to validate
          that the properties added to and modified on files and
          directories match the administrator's preferred policies,
          rejecting commits which are non-compliant in this fashion.
