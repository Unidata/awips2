      <p>Now that we've covered the day-to-day tasks that you'll
      frequently use Subversion for, we'll review a few administrative
      tasks relating to your working copy.</p>
      <div class="sect2" title="Disposing of a Working Copy">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.cleanup.disposal"></a>Disposing of a Working Copy</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>Subversion doesn't track either the state or the existence of
        working copies on the server, so there's no server overhead to
        keeping working copies around.  Likewise, there's no need to
        let the server know that you're going to delete a working
        copy.</p>
        <p>If you're likely to use a working copy again, there's
        nothing wrong with just leaving it on disk until you're ready
        to use it again, at which point all it takes is an
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> to bring it up to date and ready
        for use.</p>
        <p>However, if you're definitely not going to use a working
        copy again, you can safely delete the entire thing using
        whatever directory removal capabilities your operating system
        offers.  We recommend that before you do so you
        run <strong class="userinput"><code>svn status</code></strong> and review any files
        listed in its output that are prefixed with a
        <code class="literal">?</code> to make certain that they're not of
        importance.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="sect2" title="Recovering from an Interruption">
        <div class="titlepage">
          <div>
            <div>
              <h3 class="title"><a id="svn.tour.cleanup.interruption"></a>Recovering from an Interruption</h3>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>When Subversion modifies your working copy—either
        your files or its own administrative state—it tries to do
        so as safely as possible.  Before changing the working copy,
        Subversion logs its intentions in a private <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">to-do
        list</span>”</span>, of sorts.  Next, it performs those actions to
        affect the desired change, holding a lock on the relevant part
        of the working copy while it works.  This prevents other
        Subversion clients from accessing the working copy mid-change.
        Finally, Subversion releases its lock and cleans up its
        private to-do list.  Architecturally, this is similar to a
        journaled filesystem.  If a Subversion operation is
        interrupted (e.g, if the process is killed or if the machine
        crashes), the private to-do list remains on disk.  This allows
        Subversion to return to that list later to complete any
        unfinished operations and return your working copy to a
        consistent state.</p>
        <p>This is exactly what <span class="command"><strong>svn cleanup</strong></span> does:
        it searches your working copy and runs any leftover to-do
        items, removing working copy locks as it completes those
        operations.  If Subversion ever tells you that some part of
        your working copy is <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">locked,</span>”</span> run <span class="command"><strong>svn
        cleanup</strong></span> to remedy the problem.  The <span class="command"><strong>svn
        status</strong></span> command will inform you about administrative
        locks in the working copy, too, by displaying
        an <code class="literal">L</code> next to those locked paths:</p>
        <div class="informalexample">
          <pre class="screen">
$ svn status
  L     somedir
M       somedir/foo.c
$ svn cleanup
$ svn status
M       somedir/foo.c
</pre>
        </div>
        <p>Don't confuse these working copy administrative locks with
        the user-managed locks that Subversion users create when using
        the lock-modify-unlock model of concurrent version control;
        see the sidebar

        clarification.</p>
