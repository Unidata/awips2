      <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> command transforms an
      existing working copy to reflect a different branch.  While this
      command isn't strictly necessary for working with branches, it
      provides a nice shortcut.  In our earlier example,
      after creating your private branch, you checked out a fresh
      working copy of the new repository directory.  Instead, you can
      simply ask Subversion to change your working copy of
      <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> to mirror the new branch
      location:</p>
      <div class="informalexample">
        <pre class="screen">
$ cd calc

$ svn info | grep URL
URL: http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk

$ svn switch ^/calc/branches/my-calc-branch
U    integer.c
U    button.c
U    Makefile
Updated to revision 341.

$ svn info | grep URL
URL: http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch
</pre>
      </div>
      <p><span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Switching</span>”</span> a working copy that has no local
      modifications to a different branch results in the working copy
      looking just as it would if you'd done a fresh checkout of the
      directory.  It's usually more efficient to
      use this command, because often branches differ by only a small
      degree.  The server sends only the minimal set of changes
      necessary to make your working copy reflect the branch
      directory.</p>
      <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> command also takes a
      <code class="option">--revision</code> (<code class="option">-r</code>) option, so you
      need not always move your working copy to the
      <code class="literal">HEAD</code> of the branch.</p>
      <p>Of course, most projects are more complicated than our
      <code class="filename">calc</code> example, and contain multiple
      subdirectories.  Subversion users often follow a specific
      algorithm when using branches:</p>
      <div class="orderedlist">
        <ol class="orderedlist" type="1">
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>Copy the project's entire <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">trunk</span>”</span> to a new
          branch directory.</p>
          </li>
          <li class="listitem">
            <p>Switch only <span class="emphasis"><em>part</em></span> of the trunk
          working copy to mirror the branch.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>In other words, if a user knows that the branch work needs
      to happen on only a specific subdirectory, she uses
      <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> to move only that subdirectory to
      the branch.  (Or sometimes users will switch just a single
      working file to the branch!)  That way, the user can continue to
      receive normal <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">trunk</span>”</span> updates to most of her
      working copy, but the switched portions will remain immune
      (unless someone commits a change to her branch).  This feature
      adds a whole new dimension to the concept of a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">mixed
      working copy</span>”</span>—not only can working copies contain a
      mixture of working revisions, but they can also contain a
      mixture of repository locations as well.</p>
      <p>If your working copy contains a number of switched subtrees
      from different repository locations, it continues to function as
      normal.  When you update, you'll receive patches to each subtree
      as appropriate.  When you commit, your local changes will still
      be applied as a single, atomic change to the repository.</p>
      <p>Note that while it's okay for your working copy to reflect a
      mixture of repository locations, these locations must all be
      within the <span class="emphasis"><em>same</em></span> repository.  Subversion
      repositories aren't yet able to communicate with one another;
      that feature is planned for the
      future.<sup>[<a id="idp36438032" href="#ftn.idp36438032" class="footnote">28</a>]</sup></p>
      <div class="sidebar" title="Switches and Updates">
        <p class="title">
          <b>Switches and Updates</b>
        </p>
        <p>Have you noticed that the output of <span class="command"><strong>svn
        switch</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> looks the
        same?  The switch command is actually a superset of the update
        command.</p>
        <p>When you run <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, you're asking
        the repository to compare two trees.  The repository does so,
        and then sends a description of the differences back to the
        client.  The only difference between <span class="command"><strong>svn
        switch</strong></span> and <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span> is that the
        latter command always compares two identical repository
        paths.</p>
        <p>That is, if your working copy is a mirror of
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code>, <span class="command"><strong>svn
        update</strong></span> will automatically compare your working copy
        of <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> to
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> in the
        <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision.  If you're switching your
        working copy to a branch, <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span>
        will compare your working copy of
        <code class="filename">/calc/trunk</code> to some
        <span class="emphasis"><em>other</em></span> branch directory in the
        <code class="literal">HEAD</code> revision.</p>
        <p>In other words, an update moves your working copy through
        time.  A switch moves your working copy through time
        <span class="emphasis"><em>and</em></span> space.</p>
      </div>
      <p>Because <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> is essentially a
      variant of <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, it shares the same
      behaviors; any local modifications in your working copy are
      preserved when new data arrives from the repository.</p>
      <div class="tip" title="Tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
        <table border="0" summary="Tip">

              <p>Have you ever found yourself making some complex edits (in
        your <code class="filename">/trunk</code> working copy) and suddenly
        realized, <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">Hey, these changes ought to be in their own
        branch?</span>”</span> A great technique to do this can be summarized
        in two steps:</p>
              <div class="informalexample">
                <pre class="screen">
$ svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \
           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/newbranch \
      -m "Create branch 'newbranch'."
Committed revision 353.
$ svn switch ^/calc/branches/newbranch
At revision 353.
</pre>
              </div>
              <p>The <span class="command"><strong>svn switch</strong></span> command, like
        <span class="command"><strong>svn update</strong></span>, preserves your local edits.  At
        this point, your working copy is now a reflection of the newly
        created branch, and your next <span class="command"><strong>svn commit</strong></span>
        invocation will send your changes there.</p>
