It is used for decoding, displaying, and analyzing data, and was originally developed for the National Weather Service (NWS) by Raytheon. There is a division here at UCAR called the Unidata Program Center (UCP) which develops and supports a modified non-operational version of AWIPS for use in research and education by \nUCAR member institutions\n.  This is released as open source software, free to download and use by anyone.\n\n\nAWIPS takes a unified approach to data ingest, where most data ingested into the system comes through the \nLDM\n client pulling data feeds from the \nUnidata IDD\n. Various raw data and product files (netCDF, grib, BUFR, ASCII text, gini, AREA) are decoded and stored as HDF5 files and Postgres metadata by \nEDEX\n, which serves products and data over http.\n\n\nUnidata supports two data visualization frameworks: \nCAVE\n (an Eclipse-built Java application which runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows), and \npython-awips\n (a python package).\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: Our version of CAVE is a \nnon-operational\n version.  It does not support some features of NWS AWIPS.  Warnings and alerts cannot be issued from Unidata's CAVE.  Additional functionality may not be available as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and Install CAVE\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nDownload and Install EDEX\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nWork with Python-AWIPS\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nLicense\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUnidata AWIPS source code and binaries (RPMs) are considered to be in the public domain, meaning there are no restrictions on any download, modification, or distribution in any form (original or modified). Unidata AWIPS license information can be found \nhere\n.\n\n\n\n\nAWIPS Data in the Cloud\n\uf0c1\n\n\nUnidata and XSEDE Jetstream have partnered to offer an EDEX data server in the cloud, open to the community.  Select the server in the Connectivity Preferences dialog, or enter \nedex-cloud.unidata.ucar.edu\n (without \nhttp://\n before, or \n:9581/services\n after).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributed Computing\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAWIPS makes use of service-oriented architecture to request, process, and serve real-time meteorological data.  Because AWIPS was originally developed for use on internal NWS forecast office networks, where operational installations of AWIPS can consist of a dozen servers or more, Unidata modified the package to be more applicable in the University setting.  Because the AWIPS source code was hard-coded with the NWS network configuration, the early Unidata releases were stripped of operation-specific configurations and plugins, and released specifically for standalone installation. This made sense given that a single EDEX instance with a Solid State Drive (SSD) could handle most of the entire NOAAport data volume.  However, with GOES-R(16) now online, and more gridded forecast models being created at finer temporal and spatial resolutions, there was a need to distribute EDEX data decoding in order to handle this firehose of data.\n\n\n\n\nRead More: \nDistributed EDEX\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoftware Components\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nEDEX\n\n\nCAVE\n\n\nLDM\n\n\nedexBridge\n\n\nQpid\n\n\nPostgreSQL\n\n\nHDF5\n\n\nPyPIES\n\n\n\n\nEDEX\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe main server for AWIPS.  Qpid sends alerts to EDEX when data stored by the LDM is ready for processing.  These Qpid messages include file header information which allows EDEX to determine the appropriate data decoder to use.  The default ingest server (simply named ingest) handles all data ingest other than grib messages, which are processed by a separate ingestGrib server.  After decoding, EDEX writes metadata to the database via Postgres and saves the processed data in HDF5 via PyPIES.   A third EDEX server, request, feeds requested data to CAVE clients. EDEX ingest and request servers are started and stopped with the commands \nedex start\n and \nedex stop\n, which runs the system script \n/etc/rc.d/init.d/edex_camel\n\n\n\n\nRead More: How to Install EDEX\n\n\n\n\nCAVE\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCommon AWIPS Visualization Environment. The data rendering and visualization tool for AWIPS. CAVE contains of a number of different data display configurations called perspectives.  Perspectives used in operational forecasting environments include \nD2D\n (Display Two-Dimensional), \nGFE\n (Graphical Forecast Editor), and \nNCP\n (National Centers Perspective). CAVE is started with the command \n/awips2/cave/cave.sh\n or \ncave.sh\n\n\n\n\nRead More: How to Install CAVE\n\n\n\n\nLDM\n\uf0c1\n\n\nhttps://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm/\n\n\nThe \nLDM\n (Local Data Manager), developed and supported by Unidata, is a suite of client and server programs designed for data distribution, and is the fundamental component comprising the Unidata Internet Data Distribution (IDD) system. In AWIPS, the LDM provides data feeds for grids, surface observations, upper-air profiles, satellite and radar imagery and various other meteorological datasets.   The LDM writes data directly to file and alerts EDEX via Qpid when a file is available for processing.  The LDM is started and stopped with the commands \nedex start\n and \nedex stop\n, which runs the commands \nservice edex_ldm start\n and \nservice edex_ldm stop\n\n\nedexBridge\n\uf0c1\n\n\nedexBridge, invoked in the LDM configuration file \n/awips2/ldm/etc/ldmd.conf\n, is used by the LDM to post \"data available\" messaged to Qpid, which alerts the EDEX Ingest server that a file is ready for processing.\n\n\nQpid\n\uf0c1\n\n\nhttp://qpid.apache.org\n\n\nApache Qpid\n, the Queue Processor Interface Daemon, is the messaging system used by AWIPS to facilitate communication between services.  When the LDM receives a data file to be processed, it employs \nedexBridge\n to send EDEX ingest servers a message via Qpid.  When EDEX has finished decoding the file, it sends CAVE a message via Qpid that data are available for display or further processing. Qpid is started and stopped by \nedex start\n and \nedex stop\n, and is controlled by the system script \n/etc/rc.d/init.d/qpidd\n\n\nPostgreSQL\n\uf0c1\n\n\nhttp://www.postgresql.org\n\n\nPostgreSQL\n, known simply as Postgres, is a relational database management system (DBMS) which handles the storage and retrieval of metadata, database tables and some decoded data.  The storage and reading of EDEX metadata is handled by the Postgres DBMS.  Users may query the metadata tables by using the termainal-based front-end for Postgres called \npsql\n. Postgres is started and stopped by \nedex start\n and \nedex stop\n, and is controlled by the system script \n/etc/rc.d/init.d/edex_postgres\n\n\nHDF5\n\uf0c1\n\n\nhttp://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/\n\n\nHierarchical Data Format (v.5)\n is the primary data storage format used by AWIPS for processed grids, satellite and radar imagery and other products.   Similar to netCDF, developed and supported by Unidata, HDF5 supports multiple types of data within a single file.  For example, a single HDF5 file of radar data may contain multiple volume scans of base reflectivity and base velocity as well as derived products such as composite reflectivity.  The file may also contain data from multiple radars. HDF5 data is stored on the EDEX server in \n/awips2/edex/data/hdf5/\n.\n\n\nPyPIES\n\uf0c1\n\n\nPyPIES\n, Python Process Isolated Enhanced Storage, (httpd-pypies) was created for AWIPS to isolate the management of HDF5 Processed Data Storage from the EDEX processes.  PyPIES manages access, i.e., reads and writes, of data in the HDF5 files.  In a sense, PyPIES provides functionality similar to a DBMS (i.e PostgreSQL for metadata); all data being written to an HDF5 file is sent to PyPIES, and requests for data stored in HDF5 are processed by PyPIES.\n\n\nPyPIES is implemented in two parts: 1. The PyPIES manager is a Python application that runs as part of an Apache HTTP server, and handles requests to store and retrieve data. 2. The PyPIES logger is a Python process that coordinates logging. PyPIES is started and stopped by \nedex start\n and \nedex stop\n, and is controlled by the system script \n/etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd-pypies\n.",

            "text": "D2D Perspective\n\uf0c1\n\n\nD2D (Display 2-Dimensions) is the default AWIPS CAVE perspective, designed to mimmic the look and feel of the legacy AWIPS I system.\n\n\n\n\nSystem menus include \nCAVE\n, \nFile\n, \nView\n, \nOptions\n, and \nTools\n.\n\n\nData menus include \nModels\n, \nSurface\n, \nNCEP/Hydro\n, \nUpper Air\n, \nSatellite\n, \nLocal Radar Stations\n,  \nRadar\n, \nMRMS\n, and \nMaps\n.\n\n\nMap projection, image properties, frame control, and a few featured applications (\nWarngen\n, \nNsharp\n, and \nBrowser\n) make up the the primary D2D toolbar.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: Depending on which Operating System version of CAVE there may be other application options (\nPGEN\n, \nGEMPAK\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResource Stack\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAt bottom-right of the map window the the Resource Stack, which displays all loaded resources and map overlays, and allows for interaction and customization with the resource via a \nright-click menu\n.\n\n\nThere are three available views of the Resource Stack, the default will show all Product Resources.  The other two views are the Simple view, which shows the time, and the Map Resources.  To switch between views see the \nRight-Click Functionality\n.\n\n\nIt's important to understand that Product Resources and Map Resources are handled differently given the time-based nature of Products, compared to the static nature of maps.  Selecting the \nClear\n button will remove all Products but not remove any Map Products.\n\n\nLeft-Click Resource Name to Hide\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA left click on any resource in the stack will hide the resource and turn the label gray.  Clicking the name again makes the resource visible.\n\n\n\n\nRight-Click Background to Cycle Resource Views\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe default display in the resource stack is the Product Resources. Right Click the mouse on the map background (anywhere but on the stack itself) to switch to a Simple View, which just shows the current displayed time if product data is loaded.  Right Click again to show all Map Resources.  Right Click again to switch back to Product Resources.\n\n\nHold-Right-Click Resource Name for Menu\n\uf0c1\n\n\nDrag the mouse over a loaded resource and \nhold\n the right mouse button until a menu appears.\n\n\nThe hold-right-click menu allows you to control individual resource \nImage Properties\n, \nChange Colormaps\n, change resource color, width, density, and magnification, \nmove resources up and down\n in the stack, as well as configure custom options with other interactive resources.\n\n\n\n\nThis menu also gives you the option to unload \nthis specific product\n, as opposed to removing all data prodcuts.  Simply select the \nUnload\n option at the bottom of the resource's hold-right-click menu.\n\n\n\n\nDisplay Menu\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe display menu has many options which can alter the functionality in CAVE.\n\n\nHold-Right-Click Background for Display Menu\n\uf0c1\n\n\nHolding down the right mouse button anywhere in the map view will open a right-click menu\n\n\n\n\nShow Map Legends\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFrom the above menu select \nShow Map Legends\n and watch the Resource Stack show only map resources which are loaded to the view.\n\n\n\n\nSample Loaded Resources\n\uf0c1\n\n\nMost data types have a right-click menu option for reading out the pixel value, displayed as multi-line text for multiple resources.  This can be toggled on and off by selecting the \nSample\n option in the Display Menu.\n\n\n\n\nToggle 2 or 4-Panel Layout\n\uf0c1\n\n\nRight-click hold in the view and select \nTwo Panel Layout\n or \nFour Panel Layout\n to create duplicates of the current view.\n\n\n\n\nNotice the readout is at the same position in both panels.  Any mouse movement made on one panel will be made on the other.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy default, loading any data will load that data onto \nboth\n panels.  However, there is the option to specify which panel you would like to load data into, which can be useful if you want to have different data in each of the panels.  To access this option, simple hold-right click to pull up the Display menu and choose \nLoad to This Panel\n as shown below:\n\n\n\n\nNow, a yellow \nL\n will appear in the lower left hand corner of the panel you selected to load data to.  When data is loaded from the menus it will only load to the display desginated with the L. \nSwitch back to loading in both panels, by using the \nLoad to All Panels\n option in the Display Menu.\n\n\n\n\nFrom this multi-pane display, hold-right-click again and you will see the \nSingle Panel Layout\n option to switch back to a standard view (defaulting to the left of two, and top-left of four).\n\n\nUnload Data\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelect \nUnload All Products\n to remove all loaded graphic and image products from the display and start fresh.\n\nSelect \nUnload Graphics\n to remove all but the image products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Browser\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Product Browser allows users to browse a complete data inventory in a side window, organized by data type.  To open the Product Browser, either select the icon in the toolbar (\n), or go to the menu: \nCAVE\n > \nData Browsers\n > \nProduct Browser\n.\n\n\nSelections for \nGrid\n, \nLightning\n, \nMaps\n, \nRadar\n, \nRedbook\n, and \nSatellite\n are available.  All products loaded with the Product Browser are given default settings.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: The Linux and Mac version also have a selection for \nGFE\n available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOptions Menu\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere are several toggle options and options dialogs that are available under the \nOptions\n menu found at the top of the application.\n\n\nTime Options (Ctrl + T)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis check button enables/disables the ability to select the time interval between frames of real-time or model data. This feature has the added benefit of allowing you to view extended amounts of data (temporally) but stay within the limits of 64 frames. For example, METAR surface plots, which typically display every hour, can be set to display every three hours via the Select Valid Time and Time Resolution Dialog Box.\n\n\nWhen the Time Options check button is selected, the next product you choose to display in the Main Display Pane launches either the Select Valid Time and Time Resolution dialog box or the Select\nOffset and Tolerance dialog box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you are loading data to an empty display and the Time Options check button is enabled, the Select Valid Time and Time Resolution dialog box opens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValid Time:\n In this column of dates/times, you may choose the one that will be the first frame loaded onto the Large Display Pane. The Default option is the most recent data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime Resolution:\n This column contains various time increments in which the data can be displayed. Once you make a selection, the Valid Time Column indents the exact times that will\nbe displayed. The Default resolution displays the most recent frames available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the Time Options check button enabled for a display that already contains data, when you choose the data to be overlaid in the Main Display Pane, the Select Offset and Tolerance dialog\nbox appears, providing the following options:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffset\n: This column contains various time increments at intervals before, at, or after the time you selected for the first product that is displayed in the Main Display Pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTolerance\n: The options in this column refer to how strict the time matching is. \"None\" means an exact match, while \"Infinite\" will put the closest match in each frame, regardless of how\nfar off it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Combination (Insert)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis check button enables/disables the ability to display two images at once.\n\n\nCombined-image displays have been improved by removing the valid time for non-forecast products and removing the date string (time is kept) from the left side of the legend. In particular, this makes All-Tilts radar legends more usable.\n\n\nDisplay Properties\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis menu option opens the Display Properties dialog box. All the options available in this dialog box are also available on the Toolbar.\n\n\n\n\nLoop Properties (Ctrl + L)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nLoop Properties is another dialog box that can be opened from the Options menu or from the Loop Properties iconified button on the D2D Toolbar, or by using the Ctrl + L keyboard shortcut. The dialog allows you to adjust the forward and backward speeds, with 0 = off and 10 = maximum speed. You can set the duration of the first and last frame dwell times to between zero and 2.5 seconds.\n\n\nYou can turn looping on or off by checking the Looping check button. There is also a Looping button located on the Toolbar that enables/disables the animation in the large display pane. Finally, you can turn looping on and increase/decrease forward speed by pressing Page Up/Page Down on your keyboard, and turn looping off with the Left or Right Arrow keys.

The selected load mode is shown on the toolbar when the Load Mode menu is closed, and can also be changed by using this toolbar option as well.\n\n\nA description of the Load Mode options follow.\n\n\n\n\nLatest\n: Displays forecast data only from the latest model run, but also backfills at the beginning of the loop with available frames from previous runs to satisfy the requested number of\nframes.\n\n\nValid time seq\n: Displays the most recent data and fills empty frames with previous data. For models, it provides the product from the latest possible run for every available valid time.\n\n\nNo Backfill\n: Displays model data only from the most recent model run time with no backfilling to fill out a loop. Using this Load Mode prevents the mixing of old and new data.\n\n\nPrevious run\n: Displays the previous model run, backfilling with frames from previous runs at the beginning of the loop to satisfy the requested number of frames.\n\n\nPrev valid time seq\n: Displays the previous model run and fills empty frames with previous model data or analyses.\n\n\nPrognosis loop\n: Shows a sequence of n-hour forecasts from successive model runs.\n\n\nAnalysis loop\n: Loads a sequence of model analyses but no forecasts.\n\n\ndProg/dt\n: Selects forecasts from different model runs that all have the same valid times. This load mode is available only when there are no other products loaded in the large display\npane.\n\n\nForced\n: Puts the latest version of a selected product in all frames without time-matching.\n\n\nForecast match\n: Overlays a model product only when its forecast times match those of an initially loaded product. This load mode is available only when another product is already\nloaded in the large display pane.\n\n\nInventory\n: Selecting a product when the load mode is set to Inventory brings up a Dialog Box with the available forecast and inventory times from which you can select the product you\nwant. Inventory loads into the currently displayed frame.\n\n\nSlot\n: Puts the latest version of a selected product in the currently displayed frame.",

We choose a CWA ID that contains some active severe weather (PAH Paducah, Kentucky, in this example).\n\n\nSelect SITE Localization\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOpen \nCAVE\n > \nPreferences\n > \nLocalization\n, select the CWA site ID (PAH) for the coverage area you want to use, followed by \nApply\n and \nOkay\n and restart CAVE. Once CAVE is restarted, you should notice the new CWA at the top of the CAVE window.\n\n\n\n\nLoad single radar data from the local radars\n\uf0c1\n\n\nClick on the local radar \nkpah\n > \nZ + SRM8\n. Use the \"period\" key in the number pad to toggle between the 0.5 Reflectivity and SRM.\n\n\n\n\nLaunch WarnGen\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelect \nWarnGen\n from the D2D Toolbar or from the \nTools\n > \nWarnGen\n menu.  When started, the storm centroid marker appears and the WarnGen GUI will pop up as a separate window.\n\n\n\n\nGenerate a Storm Motion Vector\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nClick and drag \nDrag Me to Storm\n to the feature you want to track (WarnGen uses a dot to track a single storm and a line to track a line of storms).\n\n\nStep back 3 to 4 frames.\n\n\nDrag the dot to the previous position of the feature you first marked to create the storm motion vector.\n\n\nClick the \nTrack\n button in the WarnGen GUI to update the polygon based off the storm motion.\n\n\nReview the product loop and make adjustments to ensure the vector is accurate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe initial polygon may have unhatched areas that will be removed from the warning due to crossing CWAs or not meeting area thresholds in the county for inclusion. The Warned/Hatched Area button allows you to preview the polygon shape that will be issued, so you can make further edits.\n\n\nMoving Vertex Points\n\uf0c1\n\n\nVertices can be moved by clicking and dragging with the mouse. The warning polygon, including stippling, will update automatically.\n\n\n\n\nWhen reshaping your warning polygon in this manner, the philosophy is to include all areas that are at risk of experiencing severe weather covered by that warning type. Effective polygons account for uncertainty over time and typically widen downstream. \n\n\nAdd and Remove Vertex Points\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere will be some occasions where you will want to add vertices to your warning polygon. Most often, these situations will involve line warnings with bowing segments or single storm warnings where you want to account for storm motion uncertainty or multiple threat areas that may have differing storm motions.\n\n\nNew vertices are added to the warning polygon two ways. Either by \nRight Mouse Button\n \"click and hold\" or a simple \nMiddle Mouse Button\n click on the warning polygon line segment where you want to add the vertex.\n\n\nVertex points are removed from the warning polygon using the same context relative menu. Instead of selecting a line segment, you select the vertex you wish to remove and then right mouse button \nclick and hold\n and select \nremove vertex\n.\n\n\nRedrawing a Polygon\n\uf0c1\n\n\nClick the \nReset\n button to clear the current polygon and vector and reset the storm centroid marker. Generate a new storm motion by moving the storm markers and select the \nTrack\n button in the WarnGen GUI to draw the new polygon.\n\n\n\n\n\nText Window\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOnce you are satisfied with your polygon and have chosen your selections, click \nCreate Text\n in the WarnGen GUI. Initially the AWIPS Header Block window appears. Leave the top two rows bank and click \nEnter\n for the text window to open. \n\n\n\n\nUsing the customized settings in the WarnGen GUI, WarnGen translates the information into a text product that is displayed in a text window on the Text Display. The auto-generated text contains the storm speed and direction, the counties and cities affected by the warning/advisory, the valid times of the product, the warning/advisory body text (including any optional bullets selected in the GUI), and additional code to help our partners to efficiently process and disseminate the warning/advisory. The locked parts of the text are highlighted in blue and most of your text should not need to be edited if you configured your WarnGen window correctly.\n\n\n\n\nThe Unidata AWIPS release is \nnon-operational\n. You will be allowed to simulate the drawing and text-generation of warnings, but are \nprevented from transmitting\n a generated warning upstream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Edits made to product text in the editor window should be limited to items such as forecaster name/initials, call-to-action text, etc. If changes are warranted for items such as storm motion, warned counties, or Latitude/Longitude points, close the editor window and make changes using the D-2D and WarnGen graphical tools, then recreate the polygon and/or the text.",

Below is an image of the winds at different pressure layers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVertical Temperature and Moisture Profile\n\uf0c1\n\n\nVertical Temperature and Moisture profiles are available in AWIPS. Similar to NUCAPS, when loaded in CAVE, a circle is displayed for each location that has a vertical profile available. When clicking on the circle, NSHARP will open with the vertical temperature and moisture profile. These profiles are GFS data that have been adjusted based on the satellite observations.

If you are working with a Baseline, a second click with the right mouse button will return you to the original Baseline, even if you modified another Baseline in the meantime.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChoose By ID\n\uf0c1\n\n\nChoose By ID, which is a function of DMD (Digital Mesocyclone Display), is a method of selecting feature locations. The tool is used to monitor the same feature at a certain location. Without the Choose By ID tool, a monitored feature (over a period of time) could move away from its monitored location and another feature could move in its place. You can use Choose By ID to set points, baselines, and \"Home\" for conventional locations like METARs and RAOBs (Radiosonde Observations), but its primary use is for the WSR-88D-identified mesocyclone locations. You can also access the Choose By ID tool from the Tools menu on the Volume Browser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance Bearing\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelecting this tool displays six editable lines, each of which shows the azimuth and range of the labeled end of the line relative to the unlabeled end of the line. You can make the lines editable by clicking the center mouse button over the legend at the lower right of the display. Once in edit mode, a line can be moved as a unit and/or either of its end points can be adjusted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance Speed\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis tool can be used to determine the speed and direction of a storm or any other meteorological feature of interest. Selecting Distance Speed displays a Centroid Marker to move to the location of the storm or feature of interest in any two or more frames of displayed imagery (e.g., a satellite or radar loop). The system then displays a storm track with the direction (degrees) and speed (knots) of movement. When you select the Distance Speed option, the Distance Speed dialog box opens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMode\n: You have the following selections from this option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoint\n: A radio button that allows you to set the Centroid Marker as a single point.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolyline\n: A radio button that allows you to set the Centroid Marker as a polyline.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLegend\n: You have the following selections from this option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime\n: A radio button that allows you to display time with the Centroid Marker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeed\n: A radio button that allows you to display speed with the Centroid Marker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistance Scale\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEnabling this feature adds a scalebar to the bottom right hand of the main D2D display.  This tool can be used to determine the size of a storm or any other meteorological feature of interest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature Following Zoom\n\uf0c1\n\n\nWhen you zoom in over a small area to be able to view a feature in detail, animation will often cause the feature to move into and then out of the field of view. This tool allows you to follow a feature of interest even when zoomed in to a small area.\n\n\nTo use this feature, first, you need to identify the location and motion of the feature, using Distance Speed or the WarnGen tracker. Once satisfied that the tracking icon is following the feature of interest, load this tool, and the center of the zoom area will track with the Distance Speed icon. Toggling the overlay off will resume the standard zooming behavior, and toggling it back on will reinvoke the feature following zoom.\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelecting the Home option displays a marker, which is an \"X\" with the word \"Home\" next to it.\nClicking on the Home Location Legend with the center mouse button makes the marker editable; drag the \"X\" or click with the right mouse button to change its location. When the Home Marker is displayed, use the \nSample\n feature (click and hold to access the menu to turn on sampling) to display the range in miles and azimuth (in degrees) of the pointer location relative to the Home location.\n\n\n\n\nPoints\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Points option initially displays a circular 10-point pattern, labeled A through J on the Map display. Points are used to generate model soundings, time-height cross-sections, time series, and variable vs. height plots using the Volume Browser. As with the Baselines, the locations of these Points can be edited in the following manner:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Snapping\" an Interactive Point\n: If you are zoomed in over an area when you load Interactive\nPoints and no Points appear, click the right mouse button to \"snap\" a Point to where the mouse cursor is positioned. The system chooses a Point that has not been recently used. If you are currently working with a Point, then a second right mouse button click will place another Point at the location of your cursor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDynamic Reference Map\n: When you generate a model sounding, a time-height cross-section, a\ntime series, or a variable vs. height plot, a small reference map indicating the location(s) of the\nplotted sounding(s) is provided in the upper left corner of the Main Display Pane.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints may be created, deleted, hidden, and manipulated (location, name, font, and color). Points are not limited in terms of number, location, or designation. Points may also be assigned to different groups to facilitate their use. Once the Points tools have been loaded, the addition, deletion, or manipulation of Points can be accomplished in three ways:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Point Dialog Box\n: The Create Point dialog box is opened by clicking and holding the right mouse button on the map (but not on any exisiting Point) and selecting the \"New Point...\" option.\n\n\nThe Create Point dialog box opens with the Lat and Lon text boxes populated with the latitude and longiture values at the point where you had clicked the right mouse button. The latitude and longitude values can be viewed in \"Degrees : Minutes : Seconds,\" \"Degrees : Minutes,\" or \"Degrees Only\" (N and S refer to North and South; W and E refer to West and East).\n\n\nIn the Create Point dialog box, you \nmust\n:\n\n\n\n\nEnter the Point's name\n\n\n\n\nAnd \nmay\n do any of the following:\n\n\n\n\nModify the latitude and longitude values\n\n\nAssign the Point's color and font use\n\n\nAssign the Point to a group\n\n\nSelect whether the Point is movable or hidden\n\n\n\n\nBy default, individual Points do not have an assigned color. They inherit the color of the Interactive Points layer reflected in the Interactive Points product legend. You can change the color of the Interactive Points layer by right clicking on the Interactive Points product legend and selecting a color from the dropdown list. The selected color then changes all points not having an assigned color to the new color.\n\n\nPoints can be assigned to \"\n<No Group>\n\" which will organize them in the root location containing the group names when accessed by the Edit Points dialog box (see below).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit Point Dialog Box\n: The Edit Point dialog box is opened by clicking and holding the right mouse button on a Point on the map and selecting the \"Edit Point...\" option. The latitude and longitude values can be viewed in \"Degrees : Minutes : Seconds,\" \"Degrees : Minutes,\" or \"Degrees Only\" (N and S refer to North and South; W and E refer to West and East).\n\n\nBesides the option of selecting the Edit Points dialog box, you also have the option\nof selecting \"Hide Point,\" \"Delete Point,\" or \"Move Point.\" Once hidden, the Point can be\nunhidden using the Points List dialog box, where you would uncheck the checkbox under\nthe \"Hidden\" column adjacent to the Point that was hidden (see below). If \"Delete Point\" is\nselected, a pop-up opens to confirm whether you want to delete the Point. Selecting the\n\"Move Point\" option moves the Point to wherever you place the cursor on the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints List Dialog Box\n: The Points List dialog box is opened by clicking and holding the right mouse button on the Interactive Points product legend and selecting the \"Edit Points...\" option.\n\n\nThe Points List dialog box lists all the available groups and Points. Groups can be expanded to\nreview the list of Points assigned to that group by clicking the arrow next to the group name.\nInitially, the default set of Points (A-J) are listed in the D2D Group, as shown above. In the\nPoints List dialog box, Points and groups may be dragged into and out of other groups to create\nor disassemble subgroups. The Points List dialog box also includes three columns.\n\n\n\n\nPoint Name\n: Lists the group name and designated Points.\n\n\nMovable\n: Checking the checkbox adjacent to the Point disables the Point from being\nmoved.\n\n\nHidden\n: Checking the checkbox adjacent to the Point hides the Point on the map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPut home cursor\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Put home cursor tool provides an easy way to locate a METAR observation station, a city and\nstate, or a latitude/longitude coordinate. For Canada and Mexico, only the METAR observation stations and latitude/longitude coordinates are accessible. When you select Put home cursor from the Tools dropdown menu, the Home marker X is displayed and the Put Home Cursor dialog box opens.\n\n\nYou can use the Home marker, as previously described in the Home Tool, and the new Home location\n(station, city/state, or latitude/longitude) is identified in the Put Home Cursor dialog box.\nAnother way to use this tool is to type in the station, city and state, or latitude and longitude, and select Go, or hit Enter on the keypad, to move the Home marker to the specified location. The new location's nearest METAR site, city and state, and latitude and longitude appear in the Put Home Cursor dialog box. The Put Home Cursor dialog box contains the following options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation Selection\n: There are three ways to find a desired location. Once you choose the\nStation, City/State, or Lat/Lon radio button, an Entry Box is activated next to the respective label within the Put Home Cursor dialog box. Enter the desired location information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo\n: This menu button initiates the search for the desired station, city/state, or latitude/longitude. The Home marker jumps to the newly specified location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRange Rings\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe Range Rings Tool displays adjustable range rings around locations of interest to your local office. When you select Range Rings from the Tools dropdown menu, the Range Rings legend appears in the Main Display Pane. The tool comes up editable, and the rangeRing dialog box opens. (Clicking the middle mouse button over the legend toggles tool editability and closes/opens the rangeRing dialog box.) Within this dialog box, you can toggle on/off any of the target locations using the square selectors. Adjust the size of the radii (in nautical miles) by typing a new value in the entry boxes associated with each location and pressing the Apply button. You can also add labels at the center of the range ring and/or at any of the radial distances using the Labels Options menu associated with each location. Using the Movable Rings, you can add a new location at a specific point by using the Interactive Points Tool, or by typing in latitude/longitude coordinates. There is no practical limit on the number of new locations you can add to the display. The list of locations is pre-set but can be customized at a field site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunset/Sunrise\n\uf0c1\n\n\nBy typing a date, as well as the latitude and longitude of a location into the Sunrise/Sunset Tool dialog box, you can obtain the time (for any time zone) of sunrise and sunset, as well as the total length of daylight for that date. Additional features include the ability to calculate the sunrise/sunset in a different hemisphere, and the azimuthal angles, relative to true north, of the sunrise and sunset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Window\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelecting this option brings up a Text Display window that behaves in the same way as a window on the \nText Workstation\n, except that the scripts menu is disabled.\n\n\n\n\nTime of Arrival / Lead Time\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSelecting the Time Of Arrival / Lead Time option displays a tracking line from a feature's initial starting point in a past frame to its final position in the current frame. Once the final position is set, an Arrival Point is displayed. You can drag this point anywhere along the line to get the Time Of Arrival / Lead Time and Distance. You can also change the Mode from Point to Circular Front or Polyline anywhere along the line to better represent the feature(s).\n\n\n\n\nUnits Calculator\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis tool converts the units of the first column into differing units of the second column. The units are grouped into temperature, speed, distance, time, and atmospheric pressure. First, simply type the number and select the units of the value you wish to convert in the firstcolumn entry box. Then in the second column, select the desired units to which you want the original value converted. The new value will appear in the second column entry box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nText Workstation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nBy selecting one of the \"Text\" buttons, a text window opens up. In National Weather Service operations, the text workstation is used to edit new warning text as well as look up past warnings, METARs, and TAFs. This functionality is \ndisabled\n in the Unidata AWIPS version.",

These programs are accessible though the \nTools\n dropdown menu, and in individual site radar menus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimated Actual Velocity (EAV)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nA velocity (V) display from the radar shows only the radial component of the wind, so the indicated speed depends on the direction of the wind and the azimuth (direction) from the radar. Consider, for example, a north wind. Straight north of the radar, the full speed of the wind will be seen on the V product. As one moves around to the east of the radar, the radial component gets smaller, eventually reaching zero straight east of the radar. If the wind direction is known, then the actual wind speed can be computed by dividing the observed radial speed by the cosine of the angle between the radar radial and the actual direction. The EAV tool allows you to provide that angle and use the sampling function of the display to show the actual wind speed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRadar Display Controls\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Radar Display Controls dialog box is derived from the Radar Tools submenu and provides options that control the appearance of the Storm Track Information (STI), the Hail Index (HI), the Tornado Vortex Signature (TVS), the Digital Mesocyclone Display (DMD) products, the Microburst Alert (MBA) products, the Storm Relative Motion (SRM), and the SAILS products. The Radar Display Controls dialog box options are described below.\n\n\n\n\nNote\n: Our version of CAVE may not have all the products that these options are applicable to.\n\n\n\n\nThe Radar Display Controls dialog box is divided into eight sections: \nSTI\n, \nHI\n, \nTVS\n, \nDMD/MD/TVS\n, \nDMD\n, \nMBA\n, \nSRM\n, and \nSAILS\n. Each section has the following options:\n\n\nSTI (Storm Track Information)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis section has options to adjust the appearance of the STI graphic product.\n\n\n\n\nNumber of storms to show\n: This slider bar lets you choose the maximum number of storms (0 to 100) you wish to display on the STI product. The default value is 20 storms.\n\n\nType of track to show\n: This options menu allows you to choose the type of storm track that you want displayed.\n\n\n\n\nHI (Hail Index)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis portion of the Radar Display Controls dialog box contains options that alter the appearance of the HI radar graphic product. You can set the low and high algorithm thresholds of the Probability of Hail (POH) and the Probability of Severe Hail (POSH). Storms that meet the low POH threshold are indicated by small open triangles, while small solid triangles mark those that meet the high POH threshold. Similarly, large open triangles or solid triangles are plotted for the POSH low and high thresholds, respectively.\n\n\n\n\nLow hail probability (POH)\n: The storms that meet or exceed the threshold are indicated by small open triangles. The default setting is 30.\n\n\nLow severe hail probability (POSH)\n: The storms that meet or exceed the threshold are indicated by large open triangles. The default setting is 30.\n\n\nHigh hail probability\n: The storms that meet or exceed the threshold are indicated by small solid triangles. The default setting is 50.\n\n\nHigh severe hail probability\n: The storms that meet or exceed the threshold are indicated by small solid triangles. The default setting is 50.\n\n\n\n\nTVS (Tornado Vortex Signature)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere is one option in this section of the Radar Display Controls dialog box.\n\n\n\n\nShow elevated TVS\n: This toggle button lets you control the appearance of the elevated TVS radar graphic product.\n\n\n\n\nDMD, MD, TVS\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThere is one option in this section of the Radar Display Controls dialog box.\n\n\n\n\nShow extrapolated features\n: With this option, you can choose whether to show the time-extrapolated features using DMD, MD, or TVS.\n\n\n\n\nDMD (Digital Mesocyclone Display)\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nMinimum feature strength\n:  A mesocyclone clutter filter which specifies the minimum 3D strength rank use to display a mesocyclone (default is 5).\n\n\nShow overlapping Mesos\n:  Toggles whether to show overlapping mesocyclones.\n\n\nType of track to show\n:  This dropdown has option available for whether to display past and/or forcast tracks.\n\n\n\n\nMBA (Microburst Alert)\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nShow Wind Shear\n:  This option allows you to choose whether to display wind shear associated with microburts alerts.\n\n\n\n\nSRM (Storm Relative Motion)\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThe first three options in the SRM section allow you to choose where you want to derive the storm motion from.\n\n\n\n\nStorm Motion from WarnGen Track\n:  Selecting this option will display the storm motion from a WarnGen Track.\n\n\nAverage Storm Motion from STI\n:  Selecting this option will display the average storm motion from from the storm track information (STI).\n\n\nCustom Storm Motion\n:  Selecting this option allows you to specify a custom storm motion with the selections below.\n\n\nDirection\n: This slider allows you to choose the direction (in degrees??) of the storm motion.\n\n\nSpeed\n:  This slider allows you to specify the speed (in mph??) of the storm motion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAILS (Supplemental Adaptive Intra-Volume Low Level Scan)\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nEnable SAILS Frame Coordinator\n:\n\n\nEnabled (default)\n: keyboard shortcuts change where tilting up from 0.5 degree SAILS tilt will step to the next higher tilt (similar to GR2 Analyst) and Ctrl right arrow will step to the most recent tilt available for any elevation angle.\n\n\nDisabled\n: keyboard shortcuts change where tilting up from 0.5 degree SAILS tilt will not go anywhere (old confusing behavior) and Ctrl right arrow will step to the most recent time of the current tilt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVR - Shear\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis tool is used in conjunction with Doppler velocity data to calculate the velocity difference (or \"shear\") of the data directly under the end points. As with the Baselines, this feature comes up editable and the end points can be dragged to specific gates of velocity data. When in place, the speed difference (kts), distance between end points (nautical miles), shear (s-1), and distance from radar (Nmi) are automatically plotted next to the end points and in the upper left corner of the Main Display Pane. A positive shear value indicates cyclonic shear, while a negative value indicates anticyclonic shear. If either end point is not directly over velocity data, the phrase \"no data\" is reported for the shear value. This tool is also useful in determining gate-to-gate shear. Simply place the two end points directly over adjacent gates of velocity data.\n\n\n\n\n\"Snapping\" VR Shear\n: If you are zoomed in over an area when you load VR - Shear, and the VR - Shear Baseline does not appear, click the right mouse button to \"snap\" the Baseline to where the mouse cursor is located.\n\n\nVR - Shear in 4 Panel\n: You can use the VR - Shear Tool when the large display is in 4 panel\nmode. The VR - Shear overlay is loaded in different colors for each panel. There are actually\nfour copies of the program running, and each behaves independently. This means that you can\nget accurate readings in any one of the four panels \u2014 one VR - Shear panel is editable at a time. To activate, click the center mouse button on the VR - Shear legend in the desired panel and position the query line to the echoes of interest.",

            "text": "Distributed EDEX\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAWIPS makes use of service-oriented architecture to request, process, and serve real-time meteorological data. While originally developed for use on internal NWS forecast office networks, where operational installations of AWIPS could consist of a dozen servers or more, the early Unidata releases were stripped of operations-specific configurations and plugins, and released as a standalone server. This worked, since (at the time) a single EDEX instance with an attached SSD could handle most of NOAAport. However, with GOES-R(16) coming online in 2017, and more gridded forecast models being created at finer temporal and spatial resolutions, there is now a need to distribute the data decoding across multiple machines to handle this firehose of data.\n\n\n\n\nUnidata's Current EDEX Server\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCurrently, with our specific EDEX server we use a Database/Request instance that also decodes and ingests a good portion of the data.   It handles all data requests from CAVE users, as well as the majority of the decoding and ingesting for data feeds coming down on the LDM.  The \nradar\n data has been specifically exluded (from the decoding and ingest) and it has its own \nIngest/Decode Server\n which is explained in more detail below.\n\n\nFor our EDEX we have designated an instance of the ingest/decoding server to be dedicated to handling the radar data.  Our \nRadar-EDEX\n recieves and decodes all radar down from the LDM and then stores it back on our main \nDatabase/Request EDEX\n in the form of HDF5 data files and PostgreSQL metadata.\n\n\n\n\nExample Installation\n\uf0c1\n\n\nThis walkthrough will install different EDEX components on two machines in the XSEDE Jetstream Cloud, the first is used to \nstore and serve\n while the second is used to \ningest and decode\n data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDatabase/Request Server\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFor this example, this server will be referred to by the IP address \n10.0.0.9\n.\n\n\n1.

IPtables Config\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIt is required that ports 5432 and 5672 be open for the specific IP addresses of outside EDEX ingest servers.  It is \nnot recommended\n that you leave port 5432 open to all connections (since the default awips database password is known, and is not meant as a security measure).  Further, it \nis recommended\n that you change the default postgres awips user password (which then requires a reconfiguration of every remote EDEX ingest server in order to connect to this database/request server).\n\n\nvi /etc/sysconfig/iptables\n\n*filter\n:INPUT DROP [0:0]\n:FORWARD DROP [0:0]\n:OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0]\n:EXTERNAL - [0:0]\n:EDEX - [0:0]\n-A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type any -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9581 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9582 -j ACCEPT\n-A INPUT -s 10.0.0.7 -j EDEX\n-A INPUT -j EXTERNAL\n-A EXTERNAL -j REJECT\n-A EDEX -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 5432 -j ACCEPT\n-A EDEX -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 5672 -j ACCEPT\n-A EDEX -j REJECT\nCOMMIT\n\n\n\nNote the line \n-A INPUT -s 10.0.0.7 -j EDEX\n as well as the following \n-A EDEX ...\n rules for ports 5432 (PostgreSQL) and 5672 (PyPIES/HDF5).  \n\n\n\n\nThe two ports left open to all connections (9581,9582) in addition to default port 22 are for outside CAVE client connections\n\n\n\n\n3. Database Config\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIn the file \n/awips2/database/data/pg_hba.conf\n you define remote connections for all postgres tables with as \n<IP address>/32\n, after the block of IPv4 local connections:\n\n\nvi /awips2/database/data/pg_hba.conf\n\n# \"local\" is for Unix domain socket connections only\nlocal      all   all                               trust\nhostssl    all   all         10.0.0.7/32           cert clientcert=1\nhostssl    all   all         162.0.0.0/8           cert clientcert=1\nhostssl    all   all         127.0.0.1/32          cert clientcert=1\n# IPv6 local connections:\nhostssl    all   all         ::1/128               cert clientcert=1\nhostnossl  all   all         ::1/128               md5\n\n\n\n4.

While originally developed for use on internal NWS forecast office networks, where operational installations of AWIPS could consist of a dozen servers or more, the early Unidata releases were stripped of operations-specific configurations and plugins, and released as a standalone server. This worked, since (at the time) a single EDEX instance with an attached SSD could handle most of NOAAport. However, with GOES-R(16) coming online in 2017, and more gridded forecast models being created at finer temporal and spatial resolutions, there is now a need to distribute the data decoding across multiple machines to handle this firehose of data.",

            "text": "Data Distribution Files\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOverview\n\uf0c1\n\n\nEDEX uses \ndistribution files\n to alert the appropriate decoding plug-in that new data has been recieved.  These files do so by use of XML and regular expressions.  If the WMO header, or file name*, matches a regular expression listed in a distribution XML, then EDEX will put a message into the QPID queue for its corresponding decoder to recognize and process.  It is worth noting that more than one distribution file can recognize a single peice of data and notify their decoders to act.\n\n\n\n\n*Sometimes the distribution file will not look at the filename.  If this file is coming in through the LDM using a proper FILE action, then the it is possible the distribution file will only look at the header and not the filename.  If the file is ingested using the \nmanual\n endpoint (/awips2/data_store/ingest/), then this behaviour could be different.\n\n\n\n\nIf a piece of data \ndoes not\n match any distribution XML, EDEX will:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate an entry in \n/awips2/edex/logs/edex-ingest-unrecognized-files-yyyymmdd.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkip processing of the unrecognized file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistribution files are stored in the \ncommon_static\n branch of the \nLocalization Store\n (series of directories that exist in \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/\n), and a list of available files can be found in the base-level directory.  The base directory is: \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution/\n.\n\n\nFor each plug-in, the distribution file is named \n[data-type].xml\n.  For example, the distribution file for radar data is \nradar.xml\n. The distribution files follow the AWIPS base/site localization pattern: \n\n\n[root@edex]# cd /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution\n[root@edex distribution]# ls\nacars.xml         goesr.xml            poessounding.xml\nairep.xml         goessounding.xml     profiler.xml\nairmet.xml        grib.xml             radar.xml\natcf.xml          intlsigmet.xml       redbook.xml\naww.xml           lsr.xml              satellite.gini.xml\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Site Override\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBase\n files are located in \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution/\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSite\n override distribution files are located in \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/\nsite/XXX\n/distribution/\n, where \nXXX\n is the site identifier.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that site-level files override the base files; as a result, local modifications to distribution files must be made as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe base distribution file must be copied from \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution\n to \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/site/XXX/distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe local modification must be made to the file in \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/site/XXX/distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basic structure of the distribution file is:\n\n\n<requestPatterns xmlns:ns2=\"group\">\n    <regex>[pattern]</regex>\n    <regex>[pattern]</regex>\n</requestPatterns>\n\n\n\nIn each \n \ntag, \n[pattern]\n is replaced with a regular expression that will match either the filename or the WMO header of the raw data. Only data that matches a pattern in the distribution file will be processed.\n\n\nThe contents of the base version of the radar distribution file:\n\n\n[root@edex]# cd /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution/\n[root@edex]# tail -4 radar.xml\n\n<requestPatterns >\n    <regex>^SDUS[234578]. .*</regex>\n    <regex>^Level3.*</regex>\n</requestPatterns>\n\n\n\nLooking at the base radar.xml distribution file in this example, there are two regular expressions.  The first regular expression matches the standard WMO ID of radar products.   Using edexBridge the LDM will place a message in the \nexternal.dropbox\n QPID queue, indicating a radar product has arrived.  EDEX will then take the message containing the radar WMO ID (which comes from the file header) and compare it against the regular expressions in radar.xml.  If a match is found, EDEX places a message in the QPID queue Ingest.radar.  The radar decoder will then consume the message and process the radar data accordingly. \n\n\n\n\nAdding a REGEX to the Satellite Data Distribution File\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAs a quick example, suppose we have a local data source for satellite imagery that does not have a WMO header; also suppose that the data source writes to files whose names start with \nLOCAL.sat\n.\n\n\nTo add this locally produced satellite data file to the EDEX distribution; perform the following steps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy the base version of \nsatellite.gini.xml\n from the base distribution directory \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution\n into the site distribution directory \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/site/XXX/distribution\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the site version of \nsatellite.gini.xml\n, adding a new \n<regex> </regex>\n tag immediately below the existing regular expression (\n<regex> </regex>\n) tag. The contents of the tag will be \n^LOCAL.sat\n. The final result will be:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  <requestPatterns xmlns:ns2=\"group\">\n      <regex>TI[CGT]... ....</regex>\n      <regex>rad/NEXRCOMP</regex>\n      <regex>.\\*.gini.\\*</regex>\n      \n<regex>^LOCAL.sat.*</regex>\n\n  </requestPatterns>\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave the file and exit the editor. EDEX will automatically pick up the new distribution pattern.\n\n\n\n\nRaw files are written to subdirectories in  \n/awips2/data_store/\n, and a message is sent via QPID to the EDEX distribution service from the LDM. When a regular expression match is found in a data distribution file, the raw data file is placed in a queue for the matching plugin to decode and process. The distribution files are used to match file headers as well as filenames, which is how files dropped into EDEX's manual endpoint (\n/awips2/data_store/ingest/\n) are processed.\n\n\n\n\nEditing an EDEX Data Distribution File\n\uf0c1\n\n\nBecause these files are in the \ncommon/_static\n directory, they have to be manually edited using a text editor. You should not edit the base files; rather, as stated above, \nyou should copy the base version to your site and then edit the site version\n. \n\n\nThe regular expressions in the distribution files do not necessarily need to correspond with the regular expressions in the LDM \npqact.conf\n file.  It is important to note that:\n\n\n\n\nThe regex in the \npqact.conf\n file applies to the \nproductID\n that is passed through the LDM.\n\n\n\n\nand\n\n\n\n\nThe regex in the \ndistribution\n files (.xml) typically applies to the header in the file.  It can also apply to the filename, if the file is coming through the manual endpoint, or if the data has no header to begin with.\n\n\n\n\nIf patterns exist in \npqact.conf\n but there are no corresponding matching regex expressions in any distribution file, then raw data files will be written to \n/awips2/data_store/\n but will not be ingested and processed by EDEX. Entries for these non-ingested files would be written to the unrecognized files log in \n/awips/edex/logs\n.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\uf0c1\n\n\nSurface Obs\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIts distribution file is located at: \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution/obs.xml\n:\n\n\n<requestPatterns xmlns:ns2=\"group\">\n  <regex>^S[AP].*</regex>\n</requestPatterns>\n\n\n\nIt will process any file header that starts with \nSA\n or \nSP\n, which should match any WMO header that contains METAR data (e.g.\nSAUS\n, \nSPUS\n, \nSACN\n, \nSAMX\n).\n\n\n\n\nText Data\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIts distribution file is located at \n/awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution/text.xml\n:\n\n\n<requestPatterns>\n  <regex>^[ACFNRUW][A-Z][A-Z0-9]{4} [A-Z0-9]{4}</regex>\n  <regex>^S[A-CEG-Z].*</regex>\n  <!-- Only have AFOS mapping for T[BCX] -->\n  <regex>^T[BCX].*</regex>\n  <regex>^SF[A-OQ-TV-Z].*</regex>\n  <regex>^SDUS1.*</regex>\n  <regex>^SDUS4[1-6].*</regex>\n  <regex>^SDUS9[^7].*</regex>\n  <regex>^SFU[^S].*</regex>\n  <regex>^SFUS4[^1].*</regex>\n  <regex>^SFP[^A].*</regex>\n  <regex>^SFPA[^4].*</regex>\n  <regex>^SFPA4[^12].*</regex>\n  <regex>^BMBB91.*</regex>\n  <regex>^N[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{4} [A-Z0-9]{4}</regex>\n  <regex>^F[EHIJKLMQVWX].*</regex>\n  <regex>wcl_decrypted</regex>\n  <regex>ecmwf_mos_decrypted</regex>\n</requestPatterns>\n\n\n\nProcesses lots of WM patterns. The second pattern ^S[A-CEG-Z].* matches any header that starts with \nS\n except for \nSD\n or \nSF\n.  This is because it matches A through C (\nA-C\n), E, and G through Z (\nG-Z\n).

If the WMO header, or file name*, matches a regular expression listed in a distribution XML, then EDEX will put a message into the QPID queue for its corresponding decoder to recognize and process.  It is worth noting that more than one distribution file can recognize a single peice of data and notify their decoders to act.   *Sometimes the distribution file will not look at the filename.  If this file is coming in through the LDM using a proper FILE action, then the it is possible the distribution file will only look at the header and not the filename.  If the file is ingested using the  manual  endpoint (/awips2/data_store/ingest/), then this behaviour could be different.   If a piece of data  does not  match any distribution XML, EDEX will:    Create an entry in  /awips2/edex/logs/edex-ingest-unrecognized-files-yyyymmdd.log    Skip processing of the unrecognized file.    Distribution files are stored in the  common_static  branch of the  Localization Store  (series of directories that exist in  /awips2/edex/data/utility/ ), and a list of available files can be found in the base-level directory.

The first regular expression matches the standard WMO ID of radar products.   Using edexBridge the LDM will place a message in the  external.dropbox  QPID queue, indicating a radar product has arrived.  EDEX will then take the message containing the radar WMO ID (which comes from the file header) and compare it against the regular expressions in radar.xml.  If a match is found, EDEX places a message in the QPID queue Ingest.radar.  The radar decoder will then consume the message and process the radar data accordingly.",

This has to do with how long data is stored for \nafter\n it has been decoded and processed.\n\n\nThe second type of purging has to do with \nraw data\n.  This has to do with how long data is stored for \nbefore\n it has been decoded.\n\n\nProcessed Data Purging\n\uf0c1\n\n\nAWIPS uses a plugin-based purge strategy for processed \nHDF5 data\n.  This allows the user to change the purge frequency for each plugin individually, and even set purge rules for specific products for a particular plugin.

It should not be used in conjunction with installed production versions of AWIPS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following \nyum\n commands listed in these instructions may need to be run as the \nroot\n user, but the rest of the commands should be run as the local user.\n\n\n\n\n1. Remove AWIPS Instances\n\uf0c1\n\n\nFirst, make sure to remove any instances of AWIPS that are already installed, this can potentially cause problems when setting up the development environment.  Below is an example that had CAVE installed.\n\n\nUninstall with yum:\n\n\nyum clean all\nyum groupremove awips2-cave\n\n\n\nCheck to make sure all rpms have been removed:\n\n\nrpm -qa | grep awips2\n\n\n\nRemove the awips2 directory:\n\n\nrm -rf /awips2\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Set Up AWIPS Repo\n\uf0c1\n\n\nCreate a repo file named \n/etc/yum.repos.d/awips2.repo\n, and set the contents to the following:\n\n\nsudo vi /etc/yum.repos.d/awips2.repo\n\n\n\n\n[awips2repo]\nname=AWIPS II Repository\nbaseurl=https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/awips2/current/linux/rpms/\nel7-dev/\n\nenabled=1\nprotect=0\ngpgcheck=0\nproxy=_none_\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis file may already exist if AWIPS had been previously installed on the machine, so make sure to edit the baseurl.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Install the ADE\n\uf0c1\n\n\nInstall the AWIPS Development Environment (ADE) using yum.  This will install Eclipse (4.6.1), Java (1.8), Ant (1.9.6), Python 2.7 and its modules (Numpy, Matplotlib, Shapely, Jep, and others). \n\n\nyum clean all\nyum groupinstall awips2-ade\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck the libGLU package is installed by running \nrpm -qa | grep mesa-libGLU\n.  If nothing is returned, install the package via: \nyum install mesa-libGLU\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Download the Source Code\n\uf0c1\n\n\nIf it's not already installed, install git:\n\n\nyum install git\n\n\n\nNext clone all of the required repositories for AWIPS:\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/Unidata/awips2.git\ngit clone https://github.com/Unidata/awips2-cimss.git\ngit clone https://github.com/Unidata/awips2-core.git\ngit clone https://github.com/Unidata/awips2-core-foss.git\ngit clone https://github.com/Unidata/awips2-drawing.git\ngit clone https://github.com/Unidata/awips2-foss.git\ngit clone https://github.com/Unidata/awips2-goesr.git\ngit clone https://github.com/Unidata/awips2-gsd.git\ngit clone https://github.com/Unidata/awips2-ncep.git\ngit clone https://github.com/Unidata/awips2-nws.git\n\n\n\n\n\nMake sure to run \ngit checkout\n in each repo if you'd wish to develop from a branch different from the default.  It's best to do this before importing the repos into eclipse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Configure Eclipse\n\uf0c1\n\n\nOpen eclipse by running: \n/awips2/eclipse/eclipse\n\n\nIt is fine to choose the default workspace upon starting up.\n\n\nSet Preferences\n\uf0c1\n\n\nVerify or make the following changes to set up eclipse for AWIPS development:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindow > Preferences > Java > Installed JREs\n\n\n\n\nSet to \n/awips2/java\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWindow > Preferences > PyDev > Interpreters > Python Interpreter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet to \n/awips2/python/bin/python\n\n\n\n\nNote: Add all paths to the SYSTEM pythonpath if prompted\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere might be some unresolved errors.
