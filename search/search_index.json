It is used for decoding, displaying, and analyzing data, and was originally developed for the National Weather Service (NWS) by Raytheon. There is a division here at UCAR called the NSF Unidata Program Center (UPC) which develops and supports a modified non-operational version of AWIPS for use in research and education by UCAR member institutions . This is released as open source software, free to download and use by anyone. AWIPS takes a unified approach to data ingest, where most data ingested into the system comes through the LDM client pulling data feeds from the NSF Unidata IDD . Various raw data and product files (netCDF, grib, BUFR, ASCII text, gini, AREA) are decoded and stored as HDF5 files and Postgres metadata by EDEX , which serves products and data over http. We support two data visualization frameworks: CAVE (an Eclipse-built Java application which runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows), and python-awips (a python package). Download and Install CAVE \uf0c1 Download and Install EDEX \uf0c1 Work with Python-AWIPS \uf0c1 License \uf0c1 NSF Unidata AWIPS source code and binaries (RPMs) are considered to be in the public domain, meaning there are no restrictions on any download, modification, or distribution in any form (original or modified). NSF Unidata AWIPS license information can be found here . AWIPS Data in the Cloud \uf0c1 NSF Unidata and XSEDE Jetstream have partnered to offer an EDEX data server in the cloud, open to the community. Select the server in the Connectivity Preferences dialog, or enter edex-cloud.unidata.ucar.edu (without http:// before, or :9581/services after). Distributed Computing \uf0c1 AWIPS makes use of service-oriented architecture to request, process, and serve real-time meteorological data. Because AWIPS was originally developed for use on internal NWS forecast office networks, where operational installations of AWIPS can consist of a dozen servers or more, we have modified the package to be more applicable in the University setting. Our releases of AWIPS are stripped of operation-specific configurations and plugins. Originally, our EDEX installations were released specifically for standalone installation. This made sense given that a single EDEX instance with a Solid State Drive (SSD) could handle most of the entire NOAAport data volume. However, with GOES-R(16) now online, and more gridded forecast models being created at finer temporal and spatial resolutions, there was a need to distribute EDEX data decoding in order to handle this firehose of data.

Qpid sends alerts to EDEX when data stored by the LDM is ready for processing. These Qpid messages include file header information which allows EDEX to determine the appropriate data decoder to use. The default ingest server (simply named ingest) handles all data ingest other than grib messages, which are processed by a separate ingestGrib server. After decoding, EDEX writes metadata to the database via Postgres and saves the processed data in HDF5 via PyPIES. A third EDEX server, request, feeds requested data to CAVE clients. EDEX ingest and request servers are started and stopped with the commands edex start and edex stop , which runs the system script /etc/rc.d/init.d/edex_camel Read More: How to Install EDEX CAVE \uf0c1 Common AWIPS Visualization Environment. The data rendering and visualization tool for AWIPS. CAVE contains of a number of different data display configurations called perspectives. Perspectives used in operational forecasting environments include D2D (Display Two-Dimensional), GFE (Graphical Forecast Editor), and NCP (National Centers Perspective). CAVE is started with the command /awips2/cave/cave.sh or cave.sh Read More: How to Install CAVE LDM \uf0c1 https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/ldm/ The LDM (Local Data Manager), developed and supported by NSF Unidata, is a suite of client and server programs designed for data distribution, and is the fundamental component comprising the NSF Unidata Internet Data Distribution (IDD) system. In AWIPS, the LDM provides data feeds for grids, surface observations, upper-air profiles, satellite and radar imagery and various other meteorological datasets. The LDM writes data directly to file and alerts EDEX via Qpid when a file is available for processing. The LDM is started and stopped with the commands edex start and edex stop , which runs the commands service edex_ldm start and service edex_ldm stop edexBridge \uf0c1 edexBridge, invoked in the LDM configuration file /awips2/ldm/etc/ldmd.conf , is used by the LDM to post \"data available\" messaged to Qpid, which alerts the EDEX Ingest server that a file is ready for processing. Qpid \uf0c1 http://qpid.apache.org Apache Qpid , the Queue Processor Interface Daemon, is the messaging system used by AWIPS to facilitate communication between services. When the LDM receives a data file to be processed, it employs edexBridge to send EDEX ingest servers a message via Qpid. When EDEX has finished decoding the file, it sends CAVE a message via Qpid that data are available for display or further processing. Qpid is started and stopped by edex start and edex stop , and is controlled by the system script /etc/rc.d/init.d/qpidd PostgreSQL \uf0c1 http://www.postgresql.org PostgreSQL , known simply as Postgres, is a relational database management system (DBMS) which handles the storage and retrieval of metadata, database tables and some decoded data. The storage and reading of EDEX metadata is handled by the Postgres DBMS. Users may query the metadata tables by using the termainal-based front-end for Postgres called psql . Postgres is started and stopped by edex start and edex stop , and is controlled by the system script /etc/rc.d/init.d/edex_postgres HDF5 \uf0c1 http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/ Hierarchical Data Format (v.5) is the primary data storage format used by AWIPS for processed grids, satellite and radar imagery and other products. Similar to netCDF, developed and supported by NSF Unidata, HDF5 supports multiple types of data within a single file. For example, a single HDF5 file of radar data may contain multiple volume scans of base reflectivity and base velocity as well as derived products such as composite reflectivity. The file may also contain data from multiple radars. HDF5 data is stored on the EDEX server in /awips2/edex/data/hdf5/ . PyPIES \uf0c1 PyPIES , Python Process Isolated Enhanced Storage, (httpd-pypies) was created for AWIPS to isolate the management of HDF5 Processed Data Storage from the EDEX processes. PyPIES manages access, i.e., reads and writes, of data in the HDF5 files. In a sense, PyPIES provides functionality similar to a DBMS (i.e PostgreSQL for metadata); all data being written to an HDF5 file is sent to PyPIES, and requests for data stored in HDF5 are processed by PyPIES. PyPIES is implemented in two parts: 1. The PyPIES manager is a Python application that runs as part of an Apache HTTP server, and handles requests to store and retrieve data. 2. The PyPIES logger is a Python process that coordinates logging. PyPIES is started and stopped by edex start and edex stop , and is controlled by the system script /etc/rc.d/init.d/httpd-pypies .","title":"Home"},{"location":"#nsf-unidata-awips-manual","text":"https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/awips2 The Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) is a meteorological software package.

Problems \uf0c1 All Operating Systems \uf0c1 Removing caveData \uf0c1 Removing caveData (flushing the local cache) should be one of the first troubleshooting steps to take when experiencing weird behavior in CAVE. The cache lives in a folder called caveData , hence why this process is also referred to as removing or deleting caveData. Linux \uf0c1 For Linux users, the easiest way is to open a new terminal and run the following command: rm -rf ~/caveData Windows \uf0c1 For Windows users, simply delete the caveData folder in your home user directory: Mac \uf0c1 For Mac users, the easiest way is to open a new terminal and run the following command: rm -rf ~/Library/caveData Disappearing Configurations \uf0c1 If you ever notice some of the following settings you've configured/saved disappear from CAVE: Saved Displays or Procedures NSHARP settings (line thickness, etc) Colormap settings StyleRule settings This is not a fully exhaustive list, so if something else has disappeared it might be the same underlying issue still. Then it is likely we have recently changed our production EDEX server. There is a good chance we can recover your settings. To do so, please send a short email to support-awips@unidata.ucar.edu with the topic \"Missing Configurations\", and include the username(s) of the computer(s) you use to run CAVE. Remotely Connecting to CAVE \uf0c1 Since the pandemic began, many users have asked if they can use X11 forwarding or ssh tunneling to remotely connect to CAVE machines. This is not recommended or supported , and CAVE crashes in many different ways and expresses strange behavior as well. We highly recommend you download the appropriate CAVE installer on your local machine, if that is an option. If that is not an option, then the only remote access we recommend is using some type of VNC. RealVNC and nomachine are two options that are in use with positive outcomes. UltraVNC may be another option, but may have quite a delay. There may also be other free or paid software available that we are not aware of. It is likely that any VNC option you choose will also require some software or configuration to be set on the remote machine, and this will likely require administrative privileges. CAVE Spring Start Up Error \uf0c1 If you encounter the error below, please see one of our solution methods for resolving: CAVE's Spring container did not initialize correctly and CAVE must shut down. We have found the reason for this failure is because the host machine is set to use a language other than English (ie. Spanish, French, etc). To resolve this issue, either: Switch your system to English, when using CAVE or Use our Virtual Machine option . This option allows your actual machine to stay in whichever language you choose, while allowing you to run CAVE in an environment set to English. Although we list this installation under the Windows OS, this can also be done on Linux. The VM option has one notable drawback at the moment -- it cannot render RGB satellite products. Products Not Loading Properly \uf0c1 This problem is most commonly seen with the direct Windows installation. It can also manifest in the Mac installation (and is possible on Linux), and the root of the problem is not having Python installed properly for CAVE to use the packages. There are derived products which use the local machine to create and render the data. This creation is dependent upon python and its required packages working correctly. The dataset will be available in the menus and product browser, but when loaded, no data is drawn on the editor, but an entry is added to the legend. You may see an error that mentions the python package, jep . Known datasets this can affect (this is not a comprehensive list): Model Winds Metars Winds METAR Station Plot GFS Precip Type Windows \uf0c1 To correct this issue on Windows: Make sure you only have the latest version of CAVE installed (which now fully bundles the proper version of Python with the application) If you have ever previously added PYTHONHOME , PYTHONPATH , or JAVA_HOME to your user or system variables, please delete those. Open the Environment Variables window by typing \"env\" in the start bar Mac \uf0c1 To correct this issue on Mac: Make sure you have the latest verison of CAVE installed (which now fully bundles the proper version of Python with the application) Linux \uf0c1 To correct this issue on Linux: When running which python from a terminal, make sure /awips2/python/ is returned, if not, reset that environment variable, or re-run the awips_install.sh script from our installation instructions Windows \uf0c1 CAVE Map Display in Lower Left Quadrant - Windows \uf0c1 If you start up CAVE in Windows and notice the map is showing up only in the bottom left quadrant of your display, you will just need to tweak a few display settings. Try following these steps to fix your issue: Right-click on the no_env.exe, select Properties This is not the batch file (CAVE.bat) that gets installed as the CAVE shortcut on the Desktop, the no_env.exe is located in C:\\Users\\[your_username]\\AppData\\Roaming\\UCAR Unidata\\AWIPS CAVE\\no_env.exe . Select the Compatibility tab Click \"Change High DPI Settings\" At the bottom enable \"Override High DPI scaling behavior\" Change the dropdown from Application to System Windows CAVE Start Up Error \uf0c1 This should no longer be an issue for our v20 release of AWIPS. One common error some users are seeing manifests itself just after selecting an EDEX server to connect to. The following error dialogs may show up: Error purging logs Error instantiating workbench: null These errors are actually happening because the Windows machine is using IPv6, which is not compatible with AWIPS at this time. To fix the issue simply follow these steps: These screenshots may vary from your system. These instructions are per connection , so if you use multiple connections or switch between wired and wireless connections, you'll need to do the following for each of those connections so that CAVE will always run properly. 1. Close all error windows and any open windows associated with CAVE. 2. In the Windows search field, search for \"control panel\". 3. Once in the Control Panel, look for \"Network and Sharing Center\". 4. Select the adapter for your current connection (should be either \"Ethernet\" or \"Wi-Fi\"). 5. Click on \"Properties\". 6. Uncheck \"Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)\" and select OK. You may need to restart your machine for this to take effect 7. Restart CAVE. macOS \uf0c1 Monterey CAVE Warning \uf0c1 If you are running MacOS Monterey, you may see the following message when starting CAVE: Monterey versions 12.3 or newer will not support our production (v18) CAVE. Please download and install our beta v20 CAVE for newer MacOS Versions to avoid this issue. White Boxes for Surface Resources \uf0c1 If you do not have an NVIDIA graphics card and driver, you may see \"boxes\" drawn on the editor for some of the products ( METARS Station Plots and Surface Winds are the resources we're aware of), as shown below: You may be able to fix this issue: Check what graphics cards are available on your machine, by going to the Apple menu (far left, upper corner) > About This Mac > Overview tab (default): If you see two entries at the Graphics line, like the image shown above, then you have two graphics cards on your system. Intel graphics cards may be able to render our products properly. In this case, you can \"force\" your computer to use the Intel card by running the following in a terminal: sudo pmset -[a|b|c] gpuswitch 0 Where [a|b|c] is only one of those options, which mean: a: adjust settings for all scenarios b: adjust settings while running off battery c: adjust settings while connected to charger The argument 0 sets the computer to use the dedicated GPU (in our case above the Intel GPU). The two other options for that argument are: 1: automatic graphics switching 2: integrated GPU It may be smart to run pmset -g first, so you can see what the current gpuswitch setting is (likely 1 ), that way you can revert the settings if you want them back to how they were, when not using CAVE. Model Data Not Rendering \uf0c1 This behavior has appeared with MacOS Sonoma (v14) -- model data is no longer loading and you see the following errors on the screen or in the AlertView: ERROR: An internal error occured during: \"Initializing...\". ERROR: An internal error occured during: \"Product Loader\". ERROR: An internal error occured during \"Initializing...\". If you encounter this behavior, please close CAVE, clear caveData as described above , then restart CAVE and try to load the data again. If you still experience issues, please let us know at support-awips@unidata.ucar.edu Linux \uf0c1 Troubleshooting Uninstalling EDEX \uf0c1 Sometimes yum can get in a weird state and not know what AWIPS groups have been installed. For example if you are trying to remove AWIPS you may see an error: yum groupremove \"AWIPS EDEX Server\" Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, langpacks Loading mirror speeds from cached hostfile * base: mirror.dal.nexril.net * elrepo: ftp.osuosl.org * epel: mirrors.xmission.com * extras: mirrors.cat.pdx.edu * updates: mirror.mobap.edu No environment named AWIPS EDEX Server exists Maybe run: yum groups mark remove (see man yum) No packages to remove from groups To solve this issue, mark the group you want to remove and then try removing it again: yum groups mark remove \"AWIPS EDEX Server\" yum groupremove \"AWIPS EDEX Server\" Check to make sure your /etc/yum.repos.d/awips2.repo file has enabled=1 .","title":"Common Problems"},{"location":"appendix/common-problems/#common-problems","text":"","title":"Common Problems"},{"location":"appendix/common-problems/#all-operating-systems","text":"","title":"All Operating Systems"},{"location":"appendix/common-problems/#removing-cavedata","text":"Removing caveData (flushing the local cache) should be one of the first troubleshooting steps to take when experiencing weird behavior in CAVE.

Display Tools \uf0c1 The display tools are a subset of the tools available in CAVE. These programs are accessible though the Tools dropdown menu. Many of the tools listed under the Tools menu can be placed into an editable state . Do not enable the \"Hide Legends\" feature if you want to place a tool in an editable state, because access to editability is done by clicking the center mouse button, or right-clicking over the Product Legend . Az/Ran Overlay \uf0c1 This tool displays a movable azimuth/range radar map overlay. The overlay is in the \"editable\" state when displayed, and can be relocated by clicking the right mouse button. Baselines \uf0c1 Selecting Baselines displays 10 lines, labeled A-A' to J-J', along which cross-sections can be constructed from within the Volume Browser. Baselines come up editable. \"Snapping\" an Interactive Baseline: If you are zoomed in over an area when you load Interactive Baselines and no Baselines appear, press the right mouse button to \"snap\" a Baseline to where the mouse cursor is. The system chooses a Baseline that has not been recently used. If you are working with a Baseline, a second click with the right mouse button will return you to the original Baseline, even if you modified another Baseline in the meantime. Choose By ID \uf0c1 Choose By ID, which is a function of DMD (Digital Mesocyclone Display), is a method of selecting feature locations. The tool is used to monitor the same feature at a certain location. Without the Choose By ID tool, a monitored feature (over a period of time) could move away from its monitored location and another feature could move in its place. You can use Choose By ID to set points, baselines, and \"Home\" for conventional locations like METARs and RAOBs (Radiosonde Observations), but its primary use is for the WSR-88D-identified mesocyclone locations. You can also access the Choose By ID tool from the Tools menu on the Volume Browser. Distance Bearing \uf0c1 Selecting this tool displays six editable lines, each of which shows the azimuth and range of the labeled end of the line relative to the unlabeled end of the line. You can make the lines editable by clicking the center mouse button over the legend at the lower right of the display. Once in edit mode, a line can be moved as a unit and/or either of its end points can be adjusted. Distance Speed \uf0c1 This tool can be used to determine the speed and direction of a storm or any other meteorological feature of interest. Selecting Distance Speed displays a Centroid Marker to move to the location of the storm or feature of interest in any two or more frames of displayed imagery (e.g., a satellite or radar loop). The system then displays a storm track with the direction (degrees) and speed (knots) of movement. When you select the Distance Speed option, the Distance Speed dialog box opens. Mode : You have the following selections from this option. Point : A radio button that allows you to set the Centroid Marker as a single point. Polyline : A radio button that allows you to set the Centroid Marker as a polyline. Legend : You have the following selections from this option. Time : A radio button that allows you to display time with the Centroid Marker. Speed : A radio button that allows you to display speed with the Centroid Marker. Distance Scale \uf0c1 Enabling this feature adds a scalebar to the bottom right hand of the main D2D display. This tool can be used to determine the size of a storm or any other meteorological feature of interest. Feature Following Zoom \uf0c1 When you zoom in over a small area to be able to view a feature in detail, animation will often cause the feature to move into and then out of the field of view. This tool allows you to follow a feature of interest even when zoomed in to a small area. To use this feature, first, you need to identify the location and motion of the feature, using Distance Speed or the WarnGen tracker. Once satisfied that the tracking icon is following the feature of interest, load this tool, and the center of the zoom area will track with the Distance Speed icon. Toggling the overlay off will resume the standard zooming behavior, and toggling it back on will reinvoke the feature following zoom. Home \uf0c1 Selecting the Home option displays a marker, which is an \"X\" with the word \"Home\" next to it. Clicking on the Home Location Legend with the center mouse button makes the marker editable; drag the \"X\" or click with the right mouse button to change its location. When the Home Marker is displayed, use the Sample feature (click and hold to access the menu to turn on sampling) to display the range in miles and azimuth (in degrees) of the pointer location relative to the Home location. Points \uf0c1 The Points option initially displays a circular 10-point pattern, labeled A through J on the Map display. Points are used to generate model soundings, time-height cross-sections, time series, and variable vs. height plots using the Volume Browser. As with the Baselines, the locations of these Points can be edited in the following manner: \"Snapping\" an Interactive Point : If you are zoomed in over an area when you load Interactive Points and no Points appear, click the right mouse button to \"snap\" a Point to where the mouse cursor is positioned. The system chooses a Point that has not been recently used. If you are currently working with a Point, then a second right mouse button click will place another Point at the location of your cursor. Dynamic Reference Map : When you generate a model sounding, a time-height cross-section, a time series, or a variable vs. height plot, a small reference map indicating the location(s) of the plotted sounding(s) is provided in the upper left corner of the Main Display Pane. Points may be created, deleted, hidden, and manipulated (location, name, font, and color). Points are not limited in terms of number, location, or designation. Points may also be assigned to different groups to facilitate their use. Once the Points tools have been loaded, the addition, deletion, or manipulation of Points can be accomplished in three ways: Create Point Dialog Box : The Create Point dialog box is opened by clicking and holding the right mouse button on the map (but not on any exisiting Point) and selecting the \"New Point...\" option. The Create Point dialog box opens with the Lat and Lon text boxes populated with the latitude and longiture values at the point where you had clicked the right mouse button. The latitude and longitude values can be viewed in \"Degrees : Minutes : Seconds,\" \"Degrees : Minutes,\" or \"Degrees Only\" (N and S refer to North and South; W and E refer to West and East). In the Create Point dialog box, you must : Enter the Point's name And may do any of the following: Modify the latitude and longitude values Assign the Point's color and font use Assign the Point to a group Select whether the Point is movable or hidden By default, individual Points do not have an assigned color. They inherit the color of the Interactive Points layer reflected in the Interactive Points product legend. You can change the color of the Interactive Points layer by right clicking on the Interactive Points product legend and selecting a color from the dropdown list. The selected color then changes all points not having an assigned color to the new color. Points can be assigned to \" <No Group> \" which will organize them in the root location containing the group names when accessed by the Edit Points dialog box (see below). Edit Point Dialog Box : The Edit Point dialog box is opened by clicking and holding the right mouse button on a Point on the map and selecting the \"Edit Point...\" option. The latitude and longitude values can be viewed in \"Degrees : Minutes : Seconds,\" \"Degrees : Minutes,\" or \"Degrees Only\" (N and S refer to North and South; W and E refer to West and East). Besides the option of selecting the Edit Points dialog box, you also have the option of selecting \"Hide Point,\" \"Delete Point,\" or \"Move Point.\" Once hidden, the Point can be unhidden using the Points List dialog box, where you would uncheck the checkbox under the \"Hidden\" column adjacent to the Point that was hidden (see below). If \"Delete Point\" is selected, a pop-up opens to confirm whether you want to delete the Point. Selecting the \"Move Point\" option moves the Point to wherever you place the cursor on the map. Points List Dialog Box : The Points List dialog box is opened by clicking and holding the right mouse button on the Interactive Points product legend and selecting the \"Edit Points...\" option. The Points List dialog box lists all the available groups and Points. Groups can be expanded to review the list of Points assigned to that group by clicking the arrow next to the group name. Initially, the default set of Points (A-J) are listed in the D2D Group, as shown above. In the Points List dialog box, Points and groups may be dragged into and out of other groups to create or disassemble subgroups. The Points List dialog box also includes three columns. Point Name : Lists the group name and designated Points. Movable : Checking the checkbox adjacent to the Point disables the Point from being moved. Hidden : Checking the checkbox adjacent to the Point hides the Point on the map. Put home cursor \uf0c1 The Put home cursor tool provides an easy way to locate a METAR observation station, a city and state, or a latitude/longitude coordinate. For Canada and Mexico, only the METAR observation stations and latitude/longitude coordinates are accessible. When you select Put home cursor from the Tools dropdown menu, the Home marker X is displayed and the Put Home Cursor dialog box opens. You can use the Home marker, as previously described in the Home Tool, and the new Home location (station, city/state, or latitude/longitude) is identified in the Put Home Cursor dialog box. Another way to use this tool is to type in the station, city and state, or latitude and longitude, and select Go, or hit Enter on the keypad, to move the Home marker to the specified location. The new location's nearest METAR site, city and state, and latitude and longitude appear in the Put Home Cursor dialog box. The Put Home Cursor dialog box contains the following options. Location Selection : There are three ways to find a desired location. Once you choose the Station, City/State, or Lat/Lon radio button, an Entry Box is activated next to the respective label within the Put Home Cursor dialog box. Enter the desired location information. Go : This menu button initiates the search for the desired station, city/state, or latitude/longitude. The Home marker jumps to the newly specified location. Range Rings \uf0c1 The Range Rings Tool displays adjustable range rings around locations of interest to your local office. When you select Range Rings from the Tools dropdown menu, the Range Rings legend appears in the Main Display Pane. The tool comes up editable, and the rangeRing dialog box opens. (Clicking the middle mouse button over the legend toggles tool editability and closes/opens the rangeRing dialog box.) Within this dialog box, you can toggle on/off any of the target locations using the square selectors. Adjust the size of the radii (in nautical miles) by typing a new value in the entry boxes associated with each location and pressing the Apply button. You can also add labels at the center of the range ring and/or at any of the radial distances using the Labels Options menu associated with each location. Using the Movable Rings, you can add a new location at a specific point by using the Interactive Points Tool, or by typing in latitude/longitude coordinates. There is no practical limit on the number of new locations you can add to the display. The list of locations is pre-set but can be customized at a field site. Sunset/Sunrise \uf0c1 By typing a date, as well as the latitude and longitude of a location into the Sunrise/Sunset Tool dialog box, you can obtain the time (for any time zone) of sunrise and sunset, as well as the total length of daylight for that date. Additional features include the ability to calculate the sunrise/sunset in a different hemisphere, and the azimuthal angles, relative to true north, of the sunrise and sunset. Text Window \uf0c1 Selecting this option brings up a Text Display window that behaves in the same way as a window on the Text Workstation , except that the scripts menu is disabled. Time of Arrival / Lead Time \uf0c1 Selecting the Time Of Arrival / Lead Time option displays a tracking line from a feature's initial starting point in a past frame to its final position in the current frame. Once the final position is set, an Arrival Point is displayed. You can drag this point anywhere along the line to get the Time Of Arrival / Lead Time and Distance. You can also change the Mode from Point to Circular Front or Polyline anywhere along the line to better represent the feature(s). Units Calculator \uf0c1 This tool converts the units of the first column into differing units of the second column. The units are grouped into temperature, speed, distance, time, and atmospheric pressure. First, simply type the number and select the units of the value you wish to convert in the firstcolumn entry box. Then in the second column, select the desired units to which you want the original value converted. The new value will appear in the second column entry box. Text Workstation \uf0c1 By selecting one of the \"Text\" buttons, a text window opens up. In National Weather Service operations, the text workstation is used to edit new warning text as well as look up past warnings, METARs, and TAFs. This functionality is disabled in the NSF Unidata AWIPS version. Radar Tools \uf0c1 The radar tools are a subset of the tools available in CAVE. These programs are accessible though the Tools dropdown menu, and in individual site radar menus. Estimated Actual Velocity (EAV) \uf0c1 A velocity (V) display from the radar shows only the radial component of the wind, so the indicated speed depends on the direction of the wind and the azimuth (direction) from the radar. Consider, for example, a north wind. Straight north of the radar, the full speed of the wind will be seen on the V product. As one moves around to the east of the radar, the radial component gets smaller, eventually reaching zero straight east of the radar. If the wind direction is known, then the actual wind speed can be computed by dividing the observed radial speed by the cosine of the angle between the radar radial and the actual direction. The EAV tool allows you to provide that angle and use the sampling function of the display to show the actual wind speed. Radar Display Controls \uf0c1 The Radar Display Controls dialog box is derived from the Radar Tools submenu and provides options that control the appearance of the Storm Track Information (STI), the Hail Index (HI), the Tornado Vortex Signature (TVS), the Digital Mesocyclone Display (DMD) products, the Microburst Alert (MBA) products, the Storm Relative Motion (SRM), and the SAILS products. The Radar Display Controls dialog box options are described below. Note : Our version of CAVE may not have all the products that these options are applicable to. The Radar Display Controls dialog box is divided into eight sections: STI , HI , TVS , DMD/MD/TVS , DMD , MBA , SRM , and SAILS . Each section has the following options: STI (Storm Track Information) \uf0c1 This section has options to adjust the appearance of the STI graphic product. Number of storms to show : This slider bar lets you choose the maximum number of storms (0 to 100) you wish to display on the STI product. The default value is 20 storms. Type of track to show : This options menu allows you to choose the type of storm track that you want displayed. HI (Hail Index) \uf0c1 This portion of the Radar Display Controls dialog box contains options that alter the appearance of the HI radar graphic product. You can set the low and high algorithm thresholds of the Probability of Hail (POH) and the Probability of Severe Hail (POSH). Storms that meet the low POH threshold are indicated by small open triangles, while small solid triangles mark those that meet the high POH threshold. Similarly, large open triangles or solid triangles are plotted for the POSH low and high thresholds, respectively. Low hail probability (POH) : The storms that meet or exceed the threshold are indicated by small open triangles. The default setting is 30. Low severe hail probability (POSH) : The storms that meet or exceed the threshold are indicated by large open triangles. The default setting is 30. High hail probability : The storms that meet or exceed the threshold are indicated by small solid triangles. The default setting is 50. High severe hail probability : The storms that meet or exceed the threshold are indicated by small solid triangles. The default setting is 50. TVS (Tornado Vortex Signature) \uf0c1 There is one option in this section of the Radar Display Controls dialog box. Show elevated TVS : This toggle button lets you control the appearance of the elevated TVS radar graphic product. DMD, MD, TVS \uf0c1 There is one option in this section of the Radar Display Controls dialog box. Show extrapolated features : With this option, you can choose whether to show the time-extrapolated features using DMD, MD, or TVS. DMD (Digital Mesocyclone Display) \uf0c1 Minimum feature strength : A mesocyclone clutter filter which specifies the minimum 3D strength rank use to display a mesocyclone (default is 5). Show overlapping Mesos : Toggles whether to show overlapping mesocyclones. Type of track to show : This dropdown has option available for whether to display past and/or forcast tracks. MBA (Microburst Alert) \uf0c1 Show Wind Shear : This option allows you to choose whether to display wind shear associated with microburts alerts. SRM (Storm Relative Motion) \uf0c1 The first three options in the SRM section allow you to choose where you want to derive the storm motion from. Storm Motion from WarnGen Track : Selecting this option will display the storm motion from a WarnGen Track. Average Storm Motion from STI : Selecting this option will display the average storm motion from from the storm track information (STI). Custom Storm Motion : Selecting this option allows you to specify a custom storm motion with the selections below. Direction : This slider allows you to choose the direction (in degrees??) of the storm motion. Speed : This slider allows you to specify the speed (in mph??) of the storm motion. SAILS (Supplemental Adaptive Intra-Volume Low Level Scan) \uf0c1 Enable SAILS Frame Coordinator : Enabled (default) : keyboard shortcuts change where tilting up from 0.5 degree SAILS tilt will step to the next higher tilt (similar to GR2 Analyst) and Ctrl right arrow will step to the most recent tilt available for any elevation angle. Disabled : keyboard shortcuts change where tilting up from 0.5 degree SAILS tilt will not go anywhere (old confusing behavior) and Ctrl right arrow will step to the most recent time of the current tilt. VR - Shear \uf0c1 This tool is used in conjunction with Doppler velocity data to calculate the velocity difference (or \"shear\") of the data directly under the end points. As with the Baselines, this feature comes up editable and the end points can be dragged to specific gates of velocity data. When in place, the speed difference (kts), distance between end points (nautical miles), shear (s-1), and distance from radar (Nmi) are automatically plotted next to the end points and in the upper left corner of the Main Display Pane. A positive shear value indicates cyclonic shear, while a negative value indicates anticyclonic shear. If either end point is not directly over velocity data, the phrase \"no data\" is reported for the shear value. This tool is also useful in determining gate-to-gate shear. Simply place the two end points directly over adjacent gates of velocity data. \"Snapping\" VR Shear : If you are zoomed in over an area when you load VR - Shear, and the VR - Shear Baseline does not appear, click the right mouse button to \"snap\" the Baseline to where the mouse cursor is located. VR - Shear in 4 Panel : You can use the VR - Shear Tool when the large display is in 4 panel mode. The VR - Shear overlay is loaded in different colors for each panel. There are actually four copies of the program running, and each behaves independently. This means that you can get accurate readings in any one of the four panels \u2014 one VR - Shear panel is editable at a time. To activate, click the center mouse button on the VR - Shear legend in the desired panel and position the query line to the echoes of interest.","title":"Tools"},{"location":"cave/d2d-all-tools/#display-tools","text":"The display tools are a subset of the tools available in CAVE.

Volume Browser Menu Bar \uf0c1 The dropdown menus in the Volume Browser menu bar contain options for controlling and manipulating the Volume Browser or the products chosen through the Volume Browser File Clone Exit Edit Clear All Clear Sources Clear Fields Clear Panes Select None Select All Find (Ctrl+F) Tools Display Types Loop Types VB Tools \uf0c1 Baselines \uf0c1 Selecting Baselines displays 10 lines, labeled A-A' to J-J', along which cross-sections can be constructed from within the Volume Browser. These baseline resources are editable . If you are zoomed in over an area when you load baselines and none appear, press the middle mouse button (B3) to \"snap\" a baseline to where the mouse cursor is. The system chooses a baseline that has not been recently used. If you are working with a baseline, a second click with B3 will return you to the original baseline, even if you modified another baseline. Points \uf0c1 Points are used to generate model soundings, time-height cross-sections, time series, and variable vs. height plots using the Volume Browser. As with the Baselines, the locations of these Points can be edited in the following manner: \"Snapping\" an Interactive Point : If you are zoomed in over an area when you load Interactive Points and no Points appear, click B3 to \"snap\" a Point to where the mouse cursor is positioned. The system chooses a Point that has not been recently used. If you are currently working with a Point, then a second B3 click will place another Point at the location of your cursor. Dynamic Reference Map : When you generate a model sounding, a time-height cross-section, a time series, or a variable vs. height plot, a small reference map indicating the location(s) of the plotted sounding(s) is provided in the upper left corner of the Main Display Pane. Points may be created, deleted, hidden, and manipulated (location, name, font, and color). Points are not limited in terms of number, location, or designation. Points may also be assigned to different groups to facilitate their use. Choose By ID \uf0c1 Choose By ID, which is a function of DMD (Digital Mesocyclone Display), is a method of selecting feature locations. The tool is used to monitor the same feature at a certain location. Without the Choose By ID tool, a monitored feature (over a period of time) could move away from its monitored location and another feature could move in its place. You can use Choose By ID to set points, baselines, and \"Home\" for conventional locations like METARs and RAOBs (Radiosonde Observations), but its primary use is for the WSR-88D-identified mesocyclone locations. Display Types \uf0c1 Plan View (default) \uf0c1 This is the default option for the Volume Browser. From the Plan-view perspective, data are plotted onto horizontal surfaces. The additional options menu that appears in the Volume Browser menu bar allows you to choose whether you want the Plan view data to Animate in Time or Animate in Space. Cross Section \uf0c1 Allows you to view gridded data as vertical slices along specific baselines. You need to use either the Interactive Baseline Tool or the predefined latitude/longitude baselines to specify the slice you wish to see. One of the additional options menus that appear in the Volume Browser menu bar allows you to choose whether you want the cross-section data to animate in time or space, while the other options menu allows you to adjust the vertical resolution. Descriptions of these options follows. (Note that the Fields and Planes submenu labels have changed after selecting \"Cross section.\") Time Height \uf0c1 Used in conjunction with the Interactive Points Tool to enable you to view a time height cross section of a full run of gridded model data for a specific location. Additional options menus in the Volume Browser menu bar allow you to choose the direction in which you want the data to be plotted, and to adjust the vertical resolution. Var vs Hgt \uf0c1 Enables you to view a profile of a meteorological model field as it changes through height, which is displayed in millibars. By using the Interactive Points Tool, you can select one or more locations from which to plot the data. Sounding \uf0c1 Works in conjunction with the Interactive Points Tool to enable you to generate a Skew-T chart for a specific location, no additional menus appear in the Volume Browser when the Soundings setting is chosen. Time Series \uf0c1 Used in conjunction with the Interactive Points Tool to enable you to plot gridded data on a time versus data value graph for a specified point. Loop Types \uf0c1 Time \uf0c1 The default option for the Volume Browser. It allows you to view model data through time Space \uf0c1 Allows you to loop through a series of predefined latitude or longitude cross-sectional slices at a fixed time.","title":"Volume Browser"},{"location":"cave/d2d-gridded-models/#volume-browser","text":"The Volume Browser provides access to numerical models, sounding data, and selected point data sources, such as RAOB, METAR, and Profiler.

System menus include CAVE , File , View , Options , and Tools . Data menus include Models , Surface , NCEP/Hydro , Upper Air , Satellite , Local Radar Stations , Radar , MRMS , and Maps . Map projection, image properties, frame control, and a few featured applications ( Warngen , Nsharp , and Browser ) make up the the primary D2D toolbar. Note : Depending on which Operating System version of CAVE there may be other application options ( PGEN , GEMPAK ). Resource Stack \uf0c1 At bottom-right of the map window the the Resource Stack, which displays all loaded resources and map overlays, and allows for interaction and customization with the resource via a right-click menu . There are three available views of the Resource Stack, the default will show all Product Resources. The other two views are the Simple view, which shows the time, and the Map Resources. To switch between views see the Right-Click Functionality . It's important to understand that Product Resources and Map Resources are handled differently given the time-based nature of Products, compared to the static nature of maps. Selecting the Clear button will remove all Products but not remove any Map Products. Left-Click Resource Name to Hide \uf0c1 A left click on any resource in the stack will hide the resource and turn the label gray. Clicking the name again makes the resource visible. Right-Click Background to Cycle Resource Views \uf0c1 The default display in the resource stack is the Product Resources. Right Click the mouse on the map background (anywhere but on the stack itself) to switch to a Simple View, which just shows the current displayed time if product data is loaded. Right Click again to show all Map Resources. Right Click again to switch back to Product Resources. Hold-Right-Click Resource Name for Menu \uf0c1 Drag the mouse over a loaded resource and hold the right mouse button until a menu appears. The hold-right-click menu allows you to control individual resource Image Properties , Change Colormaps , change resource color, width, density, and magnification, move resources up and down in the stack, as well as configure custom options with other interactive resources. This menu also gives you the option to unload this specific product , as opposed to removing all data prodcuts. Simply select the Unload option at the bottom of the resource's hold-right-click menu. Unload a Single Resource \uf0c1 To remove or \"unload\" a single resource, use the Resource Menu. Open the Resource Menu on the resource you wish to remove and select Unload . Display Menu \uf0c1 The display menu has many options which can alter the functionality in CAVE. Hold-Right-Click Background for Display Menu \uf0c1 Holding down the right mouse button anywhere in the map view will open a right-click menu Show Map Legends \uf0c1 From the above menu select Show Map Legends and watch the Resource Stack show only map resources which are loaded to the view. Sample Loaded Resources \uf0c1 Most data types have a right-click menu option for reading out the pixel value, displayed as multi-line text for multiple resources. This can be toggled on and off by selecting the Sample option in the Display Menu. Toggle 2 or 4-Panel Layout \uf0c1 Right-click hold in the view and select Two Panel Layout or Four Panel Layout to create duplicates of the current view. Notice the readout is at the same position in both panels. Any mouse movement made on one panel will be made on the other. By default, loading any data will load that data onto both panels. However, there is the option to specify which panel you would like to load data into, which can be useful if you want to have different data in each of the panels. To access this option, simple hold-right click to pull up the Display menu and choose Load to This Panel as shown below: Now, a yellow L will appear in the lower left hand corner of the panel you selected to load data to. When data is loaded from the menus it will only load to the display desginated with the L. Switch back to loading in both panels, by using the Load to All Panels option in the Display Menu. From this multi-pane display, hold-right-click again and you will see the Single Panel Layout option to switch back to a standard view (defaulting to the left of two, and top-left of four). Unload Data \uf0c1 Select Unload All Products to remove all loaded graphic and image products from the display and start fresh. Select Unload Graphics to remove all but the image products. Product Browser \uf0c1 The Product Browser allows users to browse a complete data inventory in a side window, organized by data type. To open the Product Browser, either select the icon in the toolbar ( ), or go to the menu: CAVE > Data Browsers > Product Browser . Selections for Grid , Lightning , Maps , Radar , Redbook , and Satellite are available. All products loaded with the Product Browser are given default settings. Note : The Linux and Mac version also have a selection for GFE available. Options Menu \uf0c1 There are several toggle options and options dialogs that are available under the Options menu found at the top of the application. Time Options (Ctrl + Shift + T) \uf0c1 This check button enables/disables the ability to select the time interval between frames of real-time or model data. This feature has the added benefit of allowing you to view extended amounts of data (temporally) but stay within the limits of 64 frames. For example, METAR surface plots, which typically display every hour, can be set to display every three hours via the Select Valid Time and Time Resolution Dialog Box. When the Time Options check button is selected, the next product you choose to display in the Main Display Pane launches either the Select Valid Time and Time Resolution dialog box or the Select Offset and Tolerance dialog box. When you are loading data to an empty display and the Time Options check button is enabled, the Select Valid Time and Time Resolution dialog box opens. Valid Time: In this column of dates/times, you may choose the one that will be the first frame loaded onto the Large Display Pane. The Default option is the most recent data. Time Resolution: This column contains various time increments in which the data can be displayed. Once you make a selection, the Valid Time Column indents the exact times that will be displayed. The Default resolution displays the most recent frames available. With the Time Options check button enabled for a display that already contains data, when you choose the data to be overlaid in the Main Display Pane, the Select Offset and Tolerance dialog box appears, providing the following options: Offset : This column contains various time increments at intervals before, at, or after the time you selected for the first product that is displayed in the Main Display Pane. Tolerance : The options in this column refer to how strict the time matching is. \"None\" means an exact match, while \"Infinite\" will put the closest match in each frame, regardless of how far off it is. Image Combination (Insert) \uf0c1 This check button enables/disables the ability to display two images at once. Combined-image displays have been improved by removing the valid time for non-forecast products and removing the date string (time is kept) from the left side of the legend. In particular, this makes All-Tilts radar legends more usable. Display Properties \uf0c1 This menu option opens the Display Properties dialog box. Most of the options available in this dialog box are also available on the Toolbar , while the rest are available in the individual resource menus if that resource uses these properties. Loop Properties (Ctrl + L) \uf0c1 Loop Properties is another dialog box that can be opened from the Options menu or from the Loop Properties iconified button on the D2D Toolbar, or by using the Ctrl + L keyboard shortcut. The dialog allows you to adjust the forward and backward speeds, with 0 = off and 10 = maximum speed. You can set the duration of the first and last frame dwell times to between zero and 2.5 seconds. You can turn looping on or off by checking the Looping check button. There is also a Looping button located on the Toolbar that enables/disables the animation in the large display pane. Finally, you can turn looping on and increase/decrease forward speed by pressing Page Up/Page Down on your keyboard, and turn looping off with the Left or Right Arrow keys. On the toolbar, you can use the button to start/stop looping. Image Properties (Ctrl + I) \uf0c1 The Image Properties dialog box can be opened here (in the Options menu) or by using the Image Properties iconified button on the D2D Toolbar ( ), or using using the Ctrl + I keyboard shortcut. This dialog box provides options that allow you to change the color table; adjust the brightness, contrast, and alpha of either a single image or combined images; fade between combined images; and/or interpolate the displayed data. Set Time \uf0c1 This option allows you to set the CAVE clock, located on the bottom of the screen, to an earlier time for reviewing archived data. Set Background Color \uf0c1 You can now set the background display color on your workstation. You can also set the background display color for a single pane via mouse Button 3 (B3). Switching Perspectives \uf0c1 Switching perspectives in CAVE can be found in the CAVE > Perspective menu. D2D is one of many available CAVE perspectives. By selecting the CAVE > Perspective menu you can switch into the GFE , or Localization perspective. The GFE perspective is not currently working on the direct Windows or MacOS installations of CAVE. The GFE perspective is only enabled for the OAX site. CAVE Preferences \uf0c1 Preferences and settings for the CAVE client can be found in the CAVE > Preferences menu. Set the Localization Site and server for the workstation; configure mouse operations, change performance levels, font magnification, and text workstation hostname. Load Mode \uf0c1 Within the Display Properties dialog is the Load Mode option, which provides different ways to display data by manipulating previous model runs and inventories of data sets. The selected load mode is shown on the toolbar when the Load Mode menu is closed, and can also be changed by using this toolbar option as well. A description of the Load Mode options follow. Latest : Displays forecast data only from the latest model run, but also backfills at the beginning of the loop with available frames from previous runs to satisfy the requested number of frames. Valid time seq : Displays the most recent data and fills empty frames with previous data. For models, it provides the product from the latest possible run for every available valid time. No Backfill : Displays model data only from the most recent model run time with no backfilling to fill out a loop. Using this Load Mode prevents the mixing of old and new data. Previous run : Displays the previous model run, backfilling with frames from previous runs at the beginning of the loop to satisfy the requested number of frames. Prev valid time seq : Displays the previous model run and fills empty frames with previous model data or analyses. Prognosis loop : Shows a sequence of n-hour forecasts from successive model runs. Analysis loop : Loads a sequence of model analyses but no forecasts. dProg/dt : Selects forecasts from different model runs that all have the same valid times. This load mode is available only when there are no other products loaded in the large display pane. Forced : Puts the latest version of a selected product in all frames without time-matching. Forecast match : Overlays a model product only when its forecast times match those of an initially loaded product. This load mode is available only when another product is already loaded in the large display pane. Inventory : Selecting a product when the load mode is set to Inventory brings up a Dialog Box with the available forecast and inventory times from which you can select the product you want. Inventory loads into the currently displayed frame. Slot : Puts the latest version of a selected product in the currently displayed frame.","title":"D2D Perspective"},{"location":"cave/d2d-perspective/#d2d-perspective","text":"D2D (Display 2-Dimensions) is the default AWIPS CAVE perspective, designed to mimmic the look and feel of the legacy AWIPS I system.

Latest : Displays forecast data only from the latest model run, but also backfills at the beginning of the loop with available frames from previous runs to satisfy the requested number of frames. Valid time seq : Displays the most recent data and fills empty frames with previous data. For models, it provides the product from the latest possible run for every available valid time. No Backfill : Displays model data only from the most recent model run time with no backfilling to fill out a loop. Using this Load Mode prevents the mixing of old and new data. Previous run : Displays the previous model run, backfilling with frames from previous runs at the beginning of the loop to satisfy the requested number of frames. Prev valid time seq : Displays the previous model run and fills empty frames with previous model data or analyses. Prognosis loop : Shows a sequence of n-hour forecasts from successive model runs. Analysis loop : Loads a sequence of model analyses but no forecasts. dProg/dt : Selects forecasts from different model runs that all have the same valid times. This load mode is available only when there are no other products loaded in the large display pane. Forced : Puts the latest version of a selected product in all frames without time-matching. Forecast match : Overlays a model product only when its forecast times match those of an initially loaded product. This load mode is available only when another product is already loaded in the large display pane. Inventory : Selecting a product when the load mode is set to Inventory brings up a Dialog Box with the available forecast and inventory times from which you can select the product you want.

More detailed information can be found in the text below the video. Load NEXRAD level 3 display \uf0c1 Select the menu Radar > NEXRAD Display and note coverage areas of current severe weather. We choose a CWA ID that contains some active severe weather (BUF Buffalo, New York, in this example). Select SITE Localization \uf0c1 Open CAVE > Preferences > Localization , select the CWA site ID (BUF) for the coverage area you want to use, followed by Apply and Okay and restart CAVE. Once CAVE is restarted, you should notice the new CWA at the top of the CAVE window. Load single radar data from the local radars \uf0c1 Use the specialized site menu for the local radar data products, ex. Click on the local radar kbuf > Z + SRM8 . This menu includes several sections with submenus for all available radar data at that site. Use the \"period\" key in the number pad to toggle between the 0.5 Reflectivity and SRM. Launch WarnGen \uf0c1 Select WarnGen from the D2D Toolbar or from the Tools > WarnGen menu. When started, the storm centroid marker appears and the WarnGen GUI will pop up as a separate window. Generate a Storm Motion Vector \uf0c1 Click and drag Drag Me to Storm to the feature you want to track (WarnGen uses a dot to track a single storm and a line to track a line of storms). Step back 3 to 4 frames. Drag the dot to the previous position of the feature you first marked to create the storm motion vector. Click the Track button in the WarnGen GUI to update the polygon based off the storm motion. Review the product loop and make adjustments to ensure the vector is accurate. The initial polygon may have unhatched areas that will be removed from the warning due to crossing CWAs or not meeting area thresholds in the county for inclusion. The Warned/Hatched Area button allows you to preview the polygon shape that will be issued, so you can make further edits. Moving Vertex Points \uf0c1 Vertices can be moved by clicking and dragging with the mouse. The warning polygon, including stippling, will update automatically. When reshaping your warning polygon in this manner, the philosophy is to include all areas that are at risk of experiencing severe weather covered by that warning type. Effective polygons account for uncertainty over time and typically widen downstream. Add and Remove Vertex Points \uf0c1 There will be some occasions where you will want to add vertices to your warning polygon. Most often, these situations will involve line warnings with bowing segments or single storm warnings where you want to account for storm motion uncertainty or multiple threat areas that may have differing storm motions. New vertices are added to the warning polygon two ways. Either by Right Mouse Button \"click and hold\" or a simple Middle Mouse Button click on the warning polygon line segment where you want to add the vertex. Vertex points are removed from the warning polygon using the same context relative menu. Instead of selecting a line segment, you select the vertex you wish to remove and then right mouse button click and hold and select remove vertex . Redrawing a Polygon \uf0c1 Click the Reset button to clear the current polygon and vector and reset the storm centroid marker. Generate a new storm motion by moving the storm markers and select the Track button in the WarnGen GUI to draw the new polygon. Text Window \uf0c1 Once you are satisfied with your polygon and have chosen your selections, click Create Text in the WarnGen GUI. Initially the AWIPS Header Block window appears. Click Enter for the text window to open. This will open the Text Window. Using the customized settings in the WarnGen GUI, WarnGen translates the information into a text product that is displayed in a text window on the Text Display. The auto-generated text contains the storm speed and direction, the counties and cities affected by the warning/advisory, the valid times of the product, the warning/advisory body text (including any optional bullets selected in the GUI), and additional code to help our partners to efficiently process and disseminate the warning/advisory. The locked parts of the text are highlighted in blue and most of your text should not need to be edited if you configured your WarnGen window correctly. The NSF Unidata AWIPS release is non-operational . You will be allowed to simulate the drawing and text-generation of warnings, but are prevented from transmitting a generated warning upstream Note: Edits made to product text in the editor window should be limited to items such as forecaster name/initials, call-to-action text, etc. If changes are warranted for items such as storm motion, warned counties, or Latitude/Longitude points, close the editor window and make changes using the D-2D and WarnGen graphical tools, then recreate the polygon and/or the text.","title":"WarnGen Walkthrough"},{"location":"cave/warngen/#warngen-walkthrough","text":"WarnGen is an AWIPS graphics application for creating and issuing warnings as is done by National Weather Service offices.

These files do so by use of XML and regular expressions. If the WMO header, or file name*, matches a regular expression listed in a distribution XML, then EDEX will put a message into the QPID queue for its corresponding decoder to recognize and process. It is worth noting that more than one distribution file can recognize a single peice of data and notify their decoders to act. Sometimes the distribution file will not look at the filename. If this file is coming in through the LDM using a proper FILE action, then the it is possible the distribution file will only look at the header and not the filename. If the file is ingested using the manual endpoint (/awips2/data_store/ingest/), then this behaviour could be different. If a piece of data does not match any distribution XML, EDEX will: Create an entry in /awips2/edex/logs/edex-ingest-unrecognized-files-yyyymmdd.log Skip processing of the unrecognized file. Distribution files are stored in the common_static branch of the Localization Store (series of directories that exist in /awips2/edex/data/utility/ ), and a list of available files can be found in the base-level directory. The base directory is: /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution/ . For each plug-in, the distribution file is named [data-type].xml . For example, the distribution file for radar data is radar.xml . The distribution files follow the AWIPS base/site localization pattern: [root@edex]# cd /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution [root@edex distribution]# ls acars.xml goesr.xml poessounding.xml airep.xml goessounding.xml profiler.xml airmet.xml grib.xml radar.xml atcf.xml intlsigmet.xml redbook.xml aww.xml lsr.xml satellite.gini.xml ... Creating a Site Override \uf0c1 Base files are located in /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution/ Site override distribution files are located in /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/ site/XXX /distribution/ , where XXX is the site identifier. Note that site-level files override the base files; as a result, local modifications to distribution files must be made as follows: The base distribution file must be copied from /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution to /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/site/XXX/distribution The local modification must be made to the file in /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/site/XXX/distribution The basic structure of the distribution file is: <requestPatterns xmlns:ns2=\"group\"> <regex>[pattern]</regex> <regex>[pattern]</regex> </requestPatterns> In each tag, [pattern] is replaced with a regular expression that will match either the filename or the WMO header of the raw data. Only data that matches a pattern in the distribution file will be processed. The contents of the base version of the radar distribution file: [root@edex]# cd /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution/ [root@edex]# tail -4 radar.xml <requestPatterns > <regex>^SDUS[234578]. .*</regex> <regex>^Level3.*</regex> </requestPatterns> Looking at the base radar.xml distribution file in this example, there are two regular expressions. The first regular expression matches the standard WMO ID of radar products. Using edexBridge the LDM will place a message in the external.dropbox QPID queue, indicating a radar product has arrived. EDEX will then take the message containing the radar WMO ID (which comes from the file header) and compare it against the regular expressions in radar.xml. If a match is found, EDEX places a message in the QPID queue Ingest.radar. The radar decoder will then consume the message and process the radar data accordingly. Adding a REGEX to the Satellite Data Distribution File \uf0c1 As a quick example, suppose we have a local data source for satellite imagery that does not have a WMO header; also suppose that the data source writes to files whose names start with LOCAL.sat . To add this locally produced satellite data file to the EDEX distribution; perform the following steps. Copy the base version of satellite.gini.xml from the base distribution directory /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution into the site distribution directory /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/site/XXX/distribution Edit the site version of satellite.gini.xml , adding a new <regex> </regex> tag immediately below the existing regular expression ( <regex> </regex> ) tag. The contents of the tag will be ^LOCAL.sat . The final result will be: <requestPatterns xmlns:ns2=\"group\"> <regex>TI[CGT]... ....</regex> <regex>rad/NEXRCOMP</regex> <regex>.\\*.gini.\\*</regex> <regex>^LOCAL.sat.*</regex> </requestPatterns> Save the file and exit the editor. EDEX will automatically pick up the new distribution pattern. Raw files are written to subdirectories in /awips2/data_store/ , and a message is sent via QPID to the EDEX distribution service from the LDM. When a regular expression match is found in a data distribution file, the raw data file is placed in a queue for the matching plugin to decode and process. The distribution files are used to match file headers as well as filenames, which is how files dropped into EDEX's manual endpoint ( /awips2/data_store/ingest/ ) are processed. Editing an EDEX Data Distribution File \uf0c1 Because these files are in the common/_static directory, they have to be manually edited using a text editor. You should not edit the base files; rather, as stated above, you should copy the base version to your site and then edit the site version . The regular expressions in the distribution files do not necessarily need to correspond with the regular expressions in the LDM pqact.conf file. It is important to note that: The regex in the pqact.conf file applies to the productID that is passed through the LDM. and The regex in the distribution files (.xml) typically applies to the header in the file. It can also apply to the filename, if the file is coming through the manual endpoint, or if the data has no header to begin with. If patterns exist in pqact.conf but there are no corresponding matching regex expressions in any distribution file, then raw data files will be written to /awips2/data_store/ but will not be ingested and processed by EDEX. Entries for these non-ingested files would be written to the unrecognized files log in /awips/edex/logs . Examples \uf0c1 Surface Obs \uf0c1 Its distribution file is located at: /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution/obs.xml : <requestPatterns xmlns:ns2=\"group\"> <regex>^S[AP].*</regex> </requestPatterns> It will process any file header that starts with SA or SP , which should match any WMO header that contains METAR data (e.g. SAUS , SPUS , SACN , SAMX ). Text Data \uf0c1 Its distribution file is located at /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution/text.xml : <requestPatterns> <regex>^[ACFNRUW][A-Z][A-Z0-9]{4} [A-Z0-9]{4}</regex> <regex>^S[A-CEG-Z].*</regex> <!-- Only have AFOS mapping for T[BCX] --> <regex>^T[BCX].*</regex> <regex>^SF[A-OQ-TV-Z].*</regex> <regex>^SDUS1.*</regex> <regex>^SDUS4[1-6].*</regex> <regex>^SDUS9[^7].*</regex> <regex>^SFU[^S].*</regex> <regex>^SFUS4[^1].*</regex> <regex>^SFP[^A].*</regex> <regex>^SFPA[^4].*</regex> <regex>^SFPA4[^12].*</regex> <regex>^BMBB91.*</regex> <regex>^N[A-Z][A-Z0-9]{4} [A-Z0-9]{4}</regex> <regex>^F[EHIJKLMQVWX].*</regex> <regex>wcl_decrypted</regex> <regex>ecmwf_mos_decrypted</regex> </requestPatterns> Processes lots of WM patterns. The second pattern ^S[A-CEG-Z].* matches any header that starts with S except for SD or SF . This is because it matches A through C ( A-C ), E, and G through Z ( G-Z ). So it also matches the SA and SP files that the obs.xml plugin matches. This means that METARs are processed by both plugins simultaneously. Grib Data \uf0c1 Its distribution file is located at /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/distribution/grib.xml : <requestPatterns> <!-- Super Set of all possible WMO grib patterns --> <!-- Is specifically not restricting on CCCC since HPE isn't populating it --> <regex>^[EHLMOYZ][A-Z]{3}\\d{2}</regex> <!-- Exclude Data Delivery specific patterns --> <regexExclude>^LZ[ABC][ABC]9[123] (KWBC|KNCF)</regexExclude> <!-- ECMWF decrypted --> <regex>ecmwf_decrypted</regex> <!-- NWPS pattern --> <regex>\\p{Alpha}{3}_nwps_CG1</regex> <regex>\\p{Alpha}{3}_nwps_CG0_Trkng</regex> <!-- grib files without WMO headers --> <regex>.*grib.*</regex> <regex>.*GRIB.*</regex> <regex>.*grb.*</regex> <regex>^US058.*</regex> <regex>^CMC_reg.*</regex> </requestPatterns> The grib/grid decoder distribution file matches all numerical grids distributed over the IDD NGRID feed by matching WMO header, and from CONDUIT by matching various .grib file extensions. It also includes an example of a regexExclude message which can be used to single out matching values that aren't to be included. Addtional Information \uf0c1 Important notes about regular expressions: Any time a new entry is placed in the pqact.conf file on LDM, it is likely a corresponding entry needs to be added to the appropriate Data Distribution file in the data distribution directory, or the data file will be logged to edex-ingest-unrecognized-files-YYYYMMDD.log . The exception to this rule is if the new data coming from the LDM is a type of data that already exists and EDEX already has a distribution file with a matching regex that will recognize it. If you have written a new regex for a distribution file to match on a filename, and it is not matching, then the file most likely has a header. In this case EDEX will only look at the header to match the regex. You must change your regex to something that matches the header, not the filename.","title":"Data Distribution Files"},{"location":"edex/data-distribution-files/#data-distribution-files","text":"","title":"Data Distribution Files"},{"location":"edex/data-distribution-files/#overview","text":"EDEX uses distribution files to alert the appropriate decoding plug-in that new data has been recieved. These files do so by use of XML and regular expressions. If the WMO header, or file name*, matches a regular expression listed in a distribution XML, then EDEX will put a message into the QPID queue for its corresponding decoder to recognize and process. It is worth noting that more than one distribution file can recognize a single peice of data and notify their decoders to act. Sometimes the distribution file will not look at the filename. If this file is coming in through the LDM using a proper FILE action, then the it is possible the distribution file will only look at the header and not the filename.

Processed Data Purging \uf0c1 AWIPS uses a plugin-based purge strategy for processed HDF5 data . This allows the user to change the purge frequency for each plugin individually, and even set purge rules for specific products for a particular plugin. There is also a default purge rules file for those products which do not have specific rules written. Note : Purging is triggered by a quartz timer event that fires at 30 minutes after each hour. Purging rules are defined in XML files in the Localization Store. On EDEX, most are located in /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/purge , and follow the base/site localization pattern (e.g. site purge files are in site/XXX/purge rather than base/purge , where XXX is the site identifier). Each data set can have a purge rule defined, and the xml file is named after the data set: ls /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/purge/ acarsPurgeRules.xml bufruaPurgeRules.xml pirepPurgeRules.xml acarssoundingPurgeRules.xml ccfpPurgeRules.xml poessoundingPurgeRules.xml aggregatePurgeRules.xml convsigmetPurgeRules.xml pointsetPurgeRules.xml airepPurgeRules.xml cwaPurgeRules.xml profilerPurgeRules.xml ... Time-based purge \uf0c1 If a plugin has no XML file, the default rule of 1 day (24 hours) is used, from /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/purge/defaultPurgeRules.xml : <purgeRuleSet> <defaultRule> <period>01-00:00:00</period> </defaultRule> </purgeRuleSet> Time-based purging is set with the period tag and uses the reference time of the data. The reference time of the data is determined by the decoder. 30-day NEXRAD3 Example \uf0c1 Modify /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/purge/radarPurgeRules.xml to increase the data retention period from 1 to 31 days: <purgeRuleSet> <defaultRule> <period>31-00:00:00</period> </defaultRule> </purgeRuleSet> Note : you do NOT have to restart EDEX when you change a purge rule! Frame-Based Purge \uf0c1 Some plugins use frame-base purging, retaining and certain number of product \"versions\". /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/purge/gridPurgeRules.xml <defaultRule> <versionsToKeep>2</versionsToKeep> <period>07-00:00:00</period> </defaultRule> <rule> <keyValue>LAPS</keyValue> <versionsToKeep>30</versionsToKeep> </rule> <rule regex=\"true\"> <keyValue>NAM(?:12|20|40)</keyValue> <versionsToKeep>2</versionsToKeep> <modTimeToWait>00-00:15:00</modTimeToWait> </rule> ... In the above example, notice a default rule (2) is specified, as well as specific models with their own rules. The tag modTimeToWait can be used in conjunction with versionsToKeep and will increase the versionsToKeep by 1 if data matching this rule has been stored within modTimeToWait. Purge Logs \uf0c1 Data purge events are logged to the file edex-ingest-purge-[yyyymmdd].log , where [yyyymmdd] is the date stamp. tail -f edex-ingest-purge-20120327.log --------START LOG PURGE--------- INFO 2012-03-27 00:30:00,027 [DefaultQuartzScheduler_Worker-3] PurgeLogger: EDEX - PURGE LOGS::Skipped file with invalid fileName: afos-trigger.log INFO 2012-03-27 00:30:00,193 [DefaultQuartzScheduler_Worker-3] PurgeLogger: EDEX - PURGE LOGS::Removed 1 old files INFO 2012-03-27 00:31:23,155 [DefaultQuartzScheduler_Worker-3] PurgeLogger: EDEX - PURGE LOGS::Archived 14 files INFO 2012-03-27 00:31:23,155 [DefaultQuartzScheduler_Worker-3] PurgeLogger: EDEX - PURGE LOGS::Skipped processing 1 files INFO 2012-03-27 00:31:23,155 [DefaultQuartzScheduler_Worker-3] PurgeLogger: EDEX - PURGE LOGS::---------END LOG PURGE----------- All Purge Rules \uf0c1 To see all purge rule directories (base, site, configured): find /awips2/edex/data/utility -name purge /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/purge If any overrides have been made, then it's possible that site directories may show up as results from the find command as well. Raw Data Purging \uf0c1 Raw data are files that have been brought in by the LDM and recognized by an action in the pqact.conf file. These files are written to subdirectories of /awips2/data_store/ . This data will wait here until it is purged, from the purging rules defined in /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/archiver/purger/RAW_DATA.xml . If the purge time is too short, and the processing latencies on EDEX are too long, it is possible that EDEX will miss some of this data, and the purge times will need to be adjusted by changing the <defaultRetentionHours> or <selectedRetentionHours> tag on the relevent data sets. Default Retention \uf0c1 The defaultRetentionHours tag is defined at the beginning of the RAW_DATA.xml file. It is the duration that will apply to any piece of data that does not fall under an explicitly defined category . The default value for our EDEX is 1 hour: <archive> <name>Raw</name> <rootDir>/awips2/data_store/</rootDir> <defaultRetentionHours>1</defaultRetentionHours> <category> ... Selected Retention \uf0c1 Data sets are broken up into categories in the RAW_DATA.xml file. These categories are groupings of similar data. Each category has a selectedRetentionHours tag which specifies how long the matching data will be kept for. For example, there is a Model category which sets the purge time to 3 hours for all grib, bufrmos, and modelsounding data: ... <category> <name>Model</name> <selectedRetentionHours>3</selectedRetentionHours> <dataSet> <dirPattern>(grib|grib2)/(\\d{4})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})/(\\d{2})/(.*)</dirPattern> <displayLabel>{1} - {6}</displayLabel> <dateGroupIndices>2,3,4,5</dateGroupIndices> </dataSet> <dataSet> <dirPattern>(bufrmos|modelsounding)/(\\d{4})(\\d{2})(\\d{2})/(\\d{2})</dirPattern> <displayLabel>{1}</displayLabel> <dateGroupIndices>2,3,4,5</dateGroupIndices> </dataSet> </category> ... Logging \uf0c1 Raw data purging can be seen in the purge logs as well ( /awips2/edex/logs/edex-ingest-purge-[yyyymmdd].log where [yyyymmdd] is the date stamp).

While originally developed for use on internal NWS forecast office networks, where operational installations of AWIPS could consist of a dozen servers or more, the early NSF Unidata releases were stripped of operations-specific configurations and plugins, and released as a standalone server. This worked, since (at the time) a single EDEX instance with an attached SSD could handle most of NOAAport. However, with GOES-R(16) coming online in 2017, and more gridded forecast models being created at finer temporal and spatial resolutions, there is now a need to distribute the data decoding across multiple machines to handle this firehose of data. NSF Unidata's Current EDEX Server \uf0c1 Currently, we use a distributed architecture comprised of three machines: 1 main EDEX machine and 2 ancillary EDEX machines. The main EDEX machine decodes and processes the majority of the data, while serving and storing all of the data. Our two ancillary machines -- one for radar data and one for satellite data -- each decode and process a subset of the data and send it back to the main EDEX for storage and requesting. The main EDEX is an instance of our Database and Request Server and more information on our ancillary EDEX machines is below as well. Example Installation \uf0c1 This walkthrough will install different EDEX components on two machines in the XSEDE Jetstream Cloud, the first is used to store and serve while the second is used to ingest and decode data. Database/Request Server \uf0c1 For this example, this server will be referred to by the IP address 10.0.0.9 . 1. Install \uf0c1 wget https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/awips2/current/linux/awips_install.sh chmod 755 awips_install.sh sudo ./awips_install.sh --database 2. IPtables Config \uf0c1 It is required that ports 5432 and 5672 be open for the specific IP addresses of outside EDEX ingest servers. It is not recommended that you leave port 5432 open to all connections (since the default awips database password is known, and is not meant as a security measure). Further, it is recommended that you change the default postgres awips user password (which then requires a reconfiguration of every remote EDEX ingest server in order to connect to this database/request server). vi /etc/sysconfig/iptables *filter :INPUT DROP [0:0] :FORWARD DROP [0:0] :OUTPUT ACCEPT [0:0] :EXTERNAL - [0:0] :EDEX - [0:0] -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT -A INPUT -p icmp --icmp-type any -j ACCEPT -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9581 -j ACCEPT -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9582 -j ACCEPT -A INPUT -s 10.0.0.7 -j EDEX -A INPUT -j EXTERNAL -A EXTERNAL -j REJECT -A EDEX -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 5432 -j ACCEPT -A EDEX -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 5672 -j ACCEPT -A EDEX -j REJECT COMMIT Note the line -A INPUT -s 10.0.0.7 -j EDEX as well as the following -A EDEX ... rules for ports 5432 (PostgreSQL) and 5672 (PyPIES/HDF5). The two ports left open to all connections (9581,9582) in addition to default port 22 are for outside CAVE client connections 3. Database Config \uf0c1 In the file /awips2/database/data/pg_hba.conf you define remote connections for all postgres tables with as <IP address>/32 , after the block of IPv4 local connections and generic <IP address/24> for hostnossl: vi /awips2/database/data/pg_hba.conf # \"local\" is for Unix domain socket connections only local all all trust hostssl all all 162.0.0.0/8 cert clientcert=1 hostssl all all 127.0.0.1/32 cert clientcert=1 hostssl all all 10.0.0.7/32 cert clientcert=1 hostnossl postgres all 10.0.0.0/24 md5 hostnossl fxatext all 10.0.0.0/24 md5 hostnossl metadata all 10.0.0.0/24 md5 # IPv6 local connections: hostssl all all ::1/128 cert clientcert=1 hostnossl all all ::1/128 md5 4.

You can change your edexServiceList to only run the processes you need. You will need to update the /etc/init.d/edexServiceList file. For example replace the services with the associated right column based on the data you're processing: export SERVICES=('') Data Processing: edexServiceList radar ingestRadar satellite ingestGoesR model ingestGrids, ingestGrib 4. Configure your LDM \uf0c1 You'll want to modify your pqact.conf file to store only the data you want processed. There are example files in /awips2/ldm/etc that you can copy over to the main pqact.conf file. For example if you are wanting to process goesr data only, you can do the following steps: cd /awips2/ldm/etc mv pqact.conf pqact.conf.orig cp pqact.goesr pqact.conf You will also want to edit the pqact.conf file on your Main EDEX and comment out any entries you're processing on this EDEX server. 5.

While originally developed for use on internal NWS forecast office networks, where operational installations of AWIPS could consist of a dozen servers or more, the early NSF Unidata releases were stripped of operations-specific configurations and plugins, and released as a standalone server. This worked, since (at the time) a single EDEX instance with an attached SSD could handle most of NOAAport. However, with GOES-R(16) coming online in 2017, and more gridded forecast models being created at finer temporal and spatial resolutions, there is now a need to distribute the data decoding across multiple machines to handle this firehose of data.","title":"Distributed EDEX"},{"location":"edex/distributed-computing/#nsf-unidatas-current-edex-server","text":"Currently, we use a distributed architecture comprised of three machines: 1 main EDEX machine and 2 ancillary EDEX machines.

Create Model Definition \uf0c1 Model definition XML files are found in /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/grib/models/ . Since our grib file has a center ID of 7 (NCEP) we will edit the gribModels_NCEP-7.xml file. cd /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/grib/models/ vi gribModels_NCEP-7.xml In <gribModelSet> add an entry: <model> <name>WRF</name> <center>7</center> <subcenter>0</subcenter> <grid>201155</grid> <process> <id>89</id> </process> </model> Save the file and restart EDEX for the changes to take effect: sudo service edex_camel restart ingestGrib Now copy the wrf.grib file again to /awips2/data_store/ingest/ . If everything is correct we will not see any persistence errors since the grid is now named WRF and not GribModel:7:0:89 . cp wrf.grib /awips2/data_store/ingest/ edex log grib After you have confirmed that the grid was ingested with the given name, you can edit the D2D product menus to display the new grid . Adding a Table \uf0c1 If you ingest a piece of data and the parameter appears as unknown in the metadata database, ensure that the correct parameter tables are in place for the center/subcenter. The tables are located in /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/grib/tables/ . They are then broken into subdirectories using the following structure: /[Center]/[Subcenter]/4.2.[Discipine].[Category].table . The center and subcenter have been identified previously here , as 7 and 0, respectively. So, the corresponding directory is: /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/grib/tables/7/0/ To find the discipline of a grib product, you need the process and table values from the grib file. These are output with the wgrib -V command: wgrib -V wrf.grib rec 799:27785754:date 2014102318 ALBDO kpds5=84 kpds6=1 kpds7=0 levels=(0,0) grid=255 sfc 6hr fcst: bitmap: 736 undef ALBDO=Albedo [%] timerange 0 P1 6 P2 0 TimeU 1 nx 201 ny 155 GDS grid 3 num_in_ave 0 missing 0 center 7 subcenter 0 process 89 Table 2 scan: WE:SN winds(grid) Lambert Conf: Lat1 42.283000 Lon1 -72.361000 Lov -67.077000 Latin1 45.368000 Latin2 45.368000 < LatSP 0.000000 LonSP 0.000000 North Pole (201 x 155) Dx 4.297000 Dy 4.297000 scan 64 mode 8 min/max data 5 21.9 num bits 8 BDS_Ref 50 DecScale 1 BinScale 0 For our example, the process is 89 and table is 2 .

Create Model Definition \uf0c1 Model definition XML files are found in /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/grib/models/ . Since our grib2 file has a center of 161 (NOAA) we will edit the gribModels_NOAA-161.xml file. cd /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/grib/models/ vi gribModels_NOAA-161.xml In <gribModelSet> , under the <-- Subcenter 0 --> comment, add an entry: <model> <name>CPTI</name> <center>161</center> <subcenter>0</subcenter> <grid>600640</grid> <process> <id>97</id> </process> </model> Save the model file and restart edex: sudo service edex_camel restart ingestGrib Now if you drop cpti.grib2 into the manual endpoint again, it should ingest without any persistence errors. Adding a Table \uf0c1 If you ingest a piece of data and the parameter appears as unknown in the metadata database, ensure that the correct parameter tables are in place for the center/subcenter. The tables are located in /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/grib/tables/ . They are then broken into subdirectories using the following structure: /[Center]/[Subcenter]/4.2.[Discipine].[Category].table . There are also default parameters that all grib products may access located in this directory: /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/grib/tables/-1/-1/ If you are using a grib2 file, then you can use either the log output or the -center , -subcenter , and -full_name options on wgrib2 to get the center, subcenter, discipline, category, and parameter information: The table would be found in the directory structure using this file's center and subcenter. Finding Center \uf0c1 The center can be found by either: Running the following command: wgrib2 -center cpti.grib2 1:0:center=US NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research ... And then looking up the corresponding value for \"US NOAA Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research\" at this website , where it happens to be 161 . OR: Running the following command: wgrib2 -varX cpti.grib2 1:0:var209_255_1_ 161 _3_61 ... Where the 4th argument after \"var\" is the center id, in this case 161 . Finding Subcenter \uf0c1 To get the subcenter, simply run: wgrib2 -subcenter cpti.grib2 1:0:subcenter= 0 ... The subcenter of this file is 0 . Based on the center and subcenter, the corresponding directory is: /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/grib/tables/161/0/ Finding Discipline and Category \uf0c1 To find the exact table, we need the discipline and category: wgrib2 -full_name cpti.grib2 1:0:var 209 _ 3 _ 61 .500_m_above_mean_sea_level ... In this case the discipline is 209 and category is 3 , so the corresponding table is: 4.2.209.3.table Corresponding Table \uf0c1 The full path to the corresponding table would be: /awips2/edex/data/utility/common_static/base/grib/tables/161/0/4.2.209.3.table The parameter ID was also listed in that output as 61 . Make sure that specific parameter information is defined in the table: ... 56:56:Reflectivity at -20C:dBZ:ReflectivityM20C 57:57:Reflectivity At Lowest Altitude (RALA):dBZ:ReflectivityAtLowestAltitude 58:58:Merged Reflectivity At Lowest Altitude (RALA):dBZ:MergedReflectivityAtLowestAltitude 59:59:CPTI 80mph+:%:CPTI80mph 61:61:CPTI 110mph+:%:CPTI110mph You will have to restart ingestGrib for the changes to take place: sudo service edex_camel restart ingestGrib Now you can try re-ingesting the grib2 file . Creating Menu Items \uf0c1 After you have confirmed that the grid was ingested with the given name, you can edit the D2D product menus to display the new grid . Implementing a Production Process \uf0c1 The ingest method mentioned earlier is strictly meant to only be used during testing and development of ingesting new grid data. The reasoning is because the manual end point is very inefficent during its ingest. It creates copies of the data file and uses more resources than you'd want in a production process. Once you are satisfied with the data ingest and display in CAVE, then we highly recommend you implement a production process for ingest that does not involve the manual directory ( /awips2/edex/data/manual/ ). The recommended way is to make use of a Python script we distribute with AWIPS (EDEX). This script is called notifyAWIPS2-unidata.py and located in th /awips2/ldm/dev/ directory. If you are already using a script to manually gather the data, then adding an additional call like the one below, should ingest your data to EDEX in an efficient manner: /awips2/ldm/dev/notifyAWIPS2-unidata.py [path-to-new-grib-file] Make sure the python script is executable. To do this you may have to run chmod +x /awips2/ldm/dev/notifyAWIPS2-unidata.py Using wgrib2 \uf0c1 Mentioned in this page are a few command parameters for wgrib2 such as -grid , varX , -center , -subcenter , and -full_name . A complete list of all available parameters can be found here . Troubleshooting Grib Ingest \uf0c1 Make sure the latitude and longitude entries in your coverage specification file match those of your ingested raw grib file. There is a tolerance of +/- 0.1 degree to keep in mind when defining your coverage area. If some of the information is unknown, using a grib utility application such as wgrib and wgrib2 can be useful in determining the information that must be added to correctly process a new grib file. If you are experiencing Segmentation fault errors when running wgrib2, it may be best to install the latest version using the following command: yum install wgrib2 And then you may either need to change where wgrib2 points to, or use /bin/wgrib2 to run the recently downloaded version.","title":"Ingest a New Grid"},{"location":"edex/new-grid/#ingest-a-new-grid","text":"Unrecognized grids can be decoded by EDEX simply by dropping *.grib or *.grib2 files into /awips2/edex/data/manual/ This page explains how to ingest .grib2 products.

OpenGL 2.0 Compatible Devices At least 4GB RAM At least 2GB Disk Space for Caching NVIDIA Graphics Card Latest NVIDIA Driver While other graphics cards may work, NVIDIA Quadro graphics card is recommended for full visualization capability Linux \uf0c1 Latest Version: 23.4.1-0.2 System Requirements \uf0c1 64 bit Rocky/Red Hat 8 Bash shell environment Download and Installation Instructions \uf0c1 Download the following installer: awips_install-v23.sh In a terminal, go to the download directory Make the installer an executable by running: chmod 755 awips_install-v23.sh Run the installer: sudo ./awips_install-v23.sh --cave This will install the application in /awips2/cave/ and set the local cache to ~/caveData/ Run CAVE \uf0c1 To run CAVE either: Use the terminal and type the command cave Find the application in the Linux Desktop menu: Applications > Internet > AWIPS CAVE Additionally users can choose to run a virtual machine (VM) on Linux. Windows \uf0c1 Latest Version: 23.4.1-0.2 For Windows, we offer two installation options: a Direct Windows Installation , or a Linux Virtual Machine . The virtual machine option won't render RGB composites of satellite imagery. Method 1: Direct Windows Install \uf0c1 We offer CAVE installers at both the user-level (no administrative permissions needed), and the system-level (useful in a lab setting for instance). If you need the system-level installer, please skip to the System-Level Installation section , otherwise simply proceed with the next sections. Upgrade Existing Installation \uf0c1 If you do not currently have CAVE installed, please go directly to the Download and Installation Instructions . If you already have CAVE installed: First remove it by going to the Installed Apps settings dialog. You can access this window by: Start bar > Settings > Apps > Installed Apps. Typing \"remove\" in the start bar should bring you to this screen as well Find AWIPS CAVE, click on it, and click Uninstall. Once the uninstall is finished, simply download and install the latest version as instructed below.

Select the server in the Connectivity Preferences dialog, or enter edex-beta.unidata.ucar.edu . Local Cache \uf0c1 After connecting to an EDEX server, you will have a local directory named caveData which contains files synced from EDEX as well as a client-side cache for data and map resources. You can reset CAVE by removing the caveData directory and reconnecting to an EDEX server. Your local files have been removed, but if you are re-connecting to an EDEX server you have used before, the remote files will sync again to your local ~/caveData (bundles, colormaps, etc.). Linux: /home/<user>/caveData/ Uninstalling CAVE (Linux) \uf0c1 These are instructions to manually uninstall CAVE. However, the awips_install-v23.sh script will do these steps for you if you are installing a newer version of CAVE. 1. Make sure you have exited out of any CAVE sessions Check to make sure your /etc/yum.repos.d/awips2.repo file has enabled=1 . 2. Remove currently installed CAVE sudo yum clean all sudo yum groupremove \"AWIPS CAVE\" If you are having trouble removing a group, see the troubleshooting section. 3.

EDEX is only supported for Linux systems: CentOS and RHEL, and ideally, it should be on its own dedicated machine. It requires administrator priviledges to make root-level changes. EDEX can run on a single machine or be spread across multiple machines. To learn more about that please look at Distributed EDEX, Installing Across Multiple Machines Latest Version \uf0c1 20.3.2-2 View release notes Version 20.* of CAVE is not compatible with Version 18.* EDEX and vice versa, Version 18.* of CAVE is not compatible with Version 20.* EDEX. Functionality/Reporting \uf0c1 If you come across issues/bugs/missing functionality, we also encourage you to report it using this short form . System requirements \uf0c1 64-bit CentOS/RHEL 7 While CentOS8 has reach End of Life as of Dec. 31, 2021, CentOS7 End of Life isn't until June 30, 2024. Bash shell environment 16+ CPU cores (each CPU core can run a decorder in parallel) 24GB RAM 700GB+ Disk Space gcc-c++ package A Solid State Drive (SSD) is recommended A SSD should be mounted either to /awips2 (to contain the entire EDEX system) or to /awips2/edex/data/hdf5 (to contain the large files in the decoded data store). EDEX can scale to any system by adjusting the incoming LDM data feeds or adjusting the resources (CPU threads) allocated to each data type. EDEX is only supported for 64-bit CentOS and RHEL 7 Operating Systems. EDEX is not supported in Debian, Ubuntu, SUSE, Solaris, macOS, or Windows. You may have luck with Fedora Core 12 to 14 and Scientific Linux, but we will not provide support. Download and Installation Instructions \uf0c1 The first 3 steps should all be run as root 1. Install EDEX \uf0c1 Download and run the installer: awips_install.sh wget https://downloads.unidata.ucar.edu/awips2/current/linux/awips_install.sh chmod 755 awips_install.sh sudo ./awips_install.sh --edex awips_install.sh --edex will perform the following steps (it's always a good idea to review downloaded shell scripts): Checks to see if EDEX is currently running, if so stops the processes with the edex stop command If EDEX is installed, asks the user if it can be removed and where to backup the data to and does a yum groupremove awips2-server If the user/group awips:fxalpha does not exist, it gets created Saves the appropriate yum repo file to /etc/yum.repos.d/awips2.repo Increases process and file limits for the the awips account in /etc/security/limits.conf Creates /awips2/data_store if it does not exist already Runs yum groupinstall awips2-server If you receive an error relating to yum, then please run sudo su - -c \"[PATH_TO_INSTALL_FILE]/awips_install.sh --edex\" 2. EDEX Setup \uf0c1 The external and localhost addresses need to be specified in /etc/hosts 127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX edex-cloud edex-cloud.unidata.ucar.edu 3. Configure iptables \uf0c1 This should be a one time configuration change. Configure iptables to allow TCP connections on ports 9581 and 9582 if you want to serve data publicly to CAVE clients and the Python API. Open Port 9588 \uf0c1 If you are running a Registry (Data Delivery) server, you will also want to open port 9588 .

SELINUXTYPE=targeted Read more about selinux at redhat.com SSD Mount \uf0c1 Though a Solid State Drive is not required, it is strongly encouraged in order to handle the amount of disk IO for real-time IDD feeds. The simplest configuration would be to mount an 500GB+ SSD to /awips2 to contain both the installed software (approx. 20GB) and the real-time data (approx. 150GB per day). The default purge rules are configured such that the processed data in /awips2 does not exceed 450GB. The raw data is located in /awips2/data_store , and is scoured every hour and should not exceed 50GB. If you want to increase EDEX data retention you should mount a large disk to /awips2/edex/data/hdf5 since this will be where the archived processed data exists, and any case studies created.
